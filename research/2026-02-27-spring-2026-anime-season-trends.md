## Streaming Landscape

- **Crunchyroll:** Remains “essential” for anime fans in 2026; most simulcasts. Strong library including Demon Slayer, Spy x Family, My Hero Academia, Witch Hat Atelier, and many hidden gems.
- **Netflix:** Picks up select exclusives (Sakamoto Days, Vinland Saga, some older catalog). Less same‑day simulcast than Crunchyroll but high‑profile acquisitions.
- **Hulu:** Some carryovers from previous seasons; not as aggressive in 2026.
- **HIDIVE:** Niche titles, but facing increased competition.

## Trends & Observations

1. **Sequel dominance** (~60% of Spring 2026) — industry leaning into established IP, reducing risk. However, sequels are often strong performers (MHA, Demon Slayer).
2. **Streaming consolidation:** Crunchyroll’s lead widens; Netflix focuses on exclusive adaptations rather than simulcast breadth.
3. **Episode counts:** One Piece’s 26‑episode annual cap signals a move to more curated, higher‑budget runs. Might influence other long‑running series.
4. **Adaptation pipeline:** Popular manga from Shonen Jump and other magazines get faster anime greenlights (Kagurabachi timed unusually short after manga surge).
5. **Production quality:** Ufotable (Demon Slayer) and Bones (MHA) set high bars; new entrants (BUG FILMS) must match increasing technical expectations.

2. Demon Slayer Infinity Castle
3. Spy x Family S3
4. Sakamoto Days (new hit potential)
5. Witch Hat Atelier (critically‑acclaimed new IP)
