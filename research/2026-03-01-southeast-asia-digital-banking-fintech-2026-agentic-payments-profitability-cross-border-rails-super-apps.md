## Executive Summary

Southeast Asia's digital banking and fintech sector in 2026 is navigating a transition from growth-at-all-costs to sustainable economics — while simultaneously absorbing a wave of AI infrastructure investment. The headline dynamics are:

1. **Profitability pressure intensifying:** Globally, 61% of top 100 digital banks are profitable (up from 48% in 2024), but the overall break-even ratio across all digital banks remains below 25%. Malaysia in particular is experiencing serial digital bank CEO departures, raising fundamental questions about the business model.

2. **Agentic AI reshaping payments:** The industry has moved from generative AI (chatbots, summarization) to *agentic* AI — systems that act autonomously on behalf of users to complete transactions, compare prices, and execute payments. Mastercard's Agent Pay, TenPay Global's smart wallet platform, and HSBC's AI fraud infrastructure are the concrete examples already in production.

3. **Cross-border rails converging:** ASEAN's QR payment interoperability network (PromptPay ↔ PayNow ↔ GrabPay ↔ WeChat Pay ↔ ShopeePay) is deepening. China expanded its cross-border gateway in 2025 to onboard foreign e-wallets. Real-time settlement expectations are pushing domestic and international payment speeds to converge.

4. **Super-app rebranding:** Sea Group has renamed SeaMoney to "Monee" — a subtle signal of a broader repositioning from a payments wallet within an e-commerce ecosystem to a standalone digital financial platform.

5. **AI-for-banking partnerships proliferating:** The Agora + FPT regional partnership (announced Feb 24) is one of several deals targeting AI adoption across SEA banking infrastructure, reflecting both the opportunity and the gap in local AI deployment capability.

## Part 1: The Profitability Problem — Digital Banks' Structural Challenge

### The Global Context

According to TABInsights' World's Top 100 Digital Banks Ranking 2025:
- **61% of the top 100** global digital banks reported full-year profitability — up from 48% in 2024
- But the **break-even ratio across ALL digital banks** (not just the top 100) remains below 25%
- Time to profitability has shortened for leading second-generation institutions: from **5-6 years historically** to approximately **2-3 years** for well-positioned players
- Real-world estimates, per practitioners: add 1-2 years to those projections

**Revolut as the benchmark:** In late 2024/early 2025, Revolut completed a secondary share sale at a **$75 billion valuation**, following its fourth consecutive year of net profit. Full year 2024: **$1 billion net income on $4 billion revenue**. The path was nearly a decade long and capital-intensive. Revolut succeeded, but it is the exception rather than the template.

### Malaysia: The Case Study

Malaysia's digital banking sector has experienced notable CEO turnover in early 2026, prompting public commentary from practitioners about the structural challenges. Arsalaan Ahmed (former CEO of two banks, deeply involved in Southeast Asian digital banking) laid out the diagnostic:

**Three structural failure modes:**

**1. Sales and Distribution:**
Digital banks often underestimate distribution. Customer acquisition costs (CAC) for traditional banks: $150-350. For neobanks via digital channels: $5-15. That CAC advantage evaporates without an engaged existing user base. The successful short-term cases all came from **consortia where at least one member brought a large, relevant existing customer base** — otherwise customer acquisition and retention costs remain elevated long enough to exhaust capital.

**2. Proposition:**
Great onboarding and frictionless transactions are necessary but insufficient. Sustainable profitability requires one of three paths: (a) lending margins from creditworthy underserved customers, (b) cross-sell of insurance/investment products, or (c) B2B/SME banking where transaction volumes justify lower margins.

**3. Talent:**
Understanding both banking regulation/risk AND technology is genuinely rare. Digital banks frequently hire excellent technology talent that lacks banking intuition, or banking veterans who don't understand technology product development. The intersection is scarce and expensive.

**Prerequisite:** Alignment between board, shareholders, and regulator. Without this, execution on all three dimensions cannot overcome structural misalignment. Malaysia's CEO departures suggest alignment broke down at the governance level before operations.

### Southeast Asia Neobank Landscape (2026)

The major Southeast Asian digital banking licenses and their current status:

| Country | Bank | Major Shareholder | Status |
|---------|------|-----------------|--------|
| Singapore | GXS Bank | Grab + Singtel | Operational, scaling |
| Singapore | MariBank | Sea Group | Operational |
| Malaysia | GXBank | Grab-led consortium | Scaling, leadership flux |
| Malaysia | Boost Bank | RHB + Axiata | Scaling |
| Malaysia | AEON Bank | AEON Credit Service | Early stage |
| Thailand | (Virtual Bank licenses — Bank of Thailand, 2025-2026 process) | Multiple applicants | License awards pending/recent |
| Indonesia | Bank Jago | GoTo (Gojek) partnership | Profitable, scaling |
| Vietnam | No dedicated DBank licenses | — | Traditional banks leading digital |

**Bank Jago (Indonesia)** stands out as the SEA digital banking profitability story most often cited: built on the GoTo (formerly Gojek/Tokopedia) distribution platform, it has achieved positive unit economics faster than most regional peers by leveraging embedded finance within the super-app ecosystem.

## Part 2: Agentic AI — The 2026 Payments Transformation

### From Generative to Agentic

The payments industry consensus from multiple SEA banking executives is that 2026 is the year AI shifts from **generative** (answering questions, drafting content) to **agentic** (taking actions on behalf of users without requiring step-by-step instruction).

**Sandeep Malhotra, Executive Vice President, Core Payments, Mastercard Asia/Pacific:**
> "AI is shifting commerce from reactive to proactive, with trusted agents able to initiate transactions on behalf of consumers."

**Mastercard Agent Pay:** A production service allowing customers to complete checkout through an AI chat interface without being redirected to another website. The agent handles product selection, payment authorization, and order confirmation — compressing a 5-7 step flow to a single conversational exchange.

**Wenhui Yang, CEO, TenPay Global Singapore:**
> "Powered by artificial intelligence, digital wallets and payment systems will not only streamline how people pay but also develop a nuanced understanding of user intent and preferences, transforming payments into a more intelligent, efficient, and deeply user-centric experience."

**Practical deployment in SEA:** Smart wallet AI agents offering automatic price comparisons before checkout, personalized payment method recommendations (e.g., recommending a cashback card over a standard card for a specific merchant), and autonomous cross-border payment execution without manual currency selection.

### AI in Fraud Detection: HSBC's Numbers

**Manoj Dugar, Head of Global Payment Solutions, Asia ex Greater China, HSBC Singapore:**
AI fraud tools have enabled HSBC to detect **2-4× more potential financial crimes** while reducing **false positives by 60%**.

This is a significant operational metric. Traditional rule-based fraud detection suffers from a precision-recall tradeoff: catching more fraud means more false positives (legitimate transactions flagged, customers frustrated). The 60% false positive reduction while simultaneously catching more fraud suggests AI is moving along the Pareto frontier rather than just trading off precision against recall.

Secondary benefits cited: reduced time for client onboarding, document processing, and request response — reducing operational headcount requirements for back-office functions.

### The Agora + FPT Regional Partnership

On February 24, 2026, **Agora (NASDAQ: API)** — a global real-time engagement and conversational AI company — and **FPT**, Vietnam's leading IT services firm, announced a **strategic partnership to expand AI adoption across Southeast Asia's banking and financial services sector**.

**Scope:** Conversational AI interfaces for banking customers (voice/chat), real-time engagement infrastructure for remote banking services, AI-powered customer service and triage.

**Why this matters regionally:** Regulatory requirements are tightening across SEA. Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand have increased scrutiny of cybersecurity, operational resilience, and consumer data protection. Banks are simultaneously under pressure to improve digital engagement metrics (time-to-serve, NPS, resolution rates) and meet tightened compliance requirements. AI partnerships provide a faster path to both than in-house development.

## Part 3: Cross-Border Payments — The Convergence of Asian Rails

### The ASEAN QR Interoperability Network

One of the under-appreciated structural stories in SEA payments is how far the QR payment interoperability network has advanced:

**Interconnected nodes as of 2026:**
- **Thailand:** PromptPay (BOT-operated, linked to Singapore, Malaysia, China, India, Japan, Vietnam)
- **Singapore:** PayNow (MAS-operated, interoperable with PromptPay, PayLah!, DuitNow)
- **Malaysia:** DuitNow (Bank Negara, linked to PayNow and PromptPay)
- **Indonesia:** QRIS (Bank Indonesia, regional expansion ongoing)
- **Philippines:** InstaPay (BSP-operated, expanding cross-border)
- **China:** WeChat Pay / Alipay (via China's cross-border gateway, now integrated with GrabPay, ShopeePay, PayPal)

**China's 2025 expansion:** China expanded its cross-border interconnection payment gateway to onboard foreign e-wallets including PayPal, GrabPay, and ShopeePay. This enables Chinese consumers traveling in SEA to pay at local merchants, and SEA consumers traveling in China to pay with familiar local wallets.

**Practical example (Thailand):** PromptPay has a cross-border network working with banks in Singapore, China, Malaysia, and other countries. A Malaysian tourist in Bangkok can pay at a 7-Eleven using DuitNow QR, which routes through the PromptPay-DuitNow interoperability link — no currency exchange app required, no cash required, no foreign transaction fee in many cases.

### ISO 20022 and the Technical Foundation

The shift to **ISO 20022** messaging standards across ASEAN's payment systems is the behind-the-scenes driver of cross-border convergence. ISO 20022 carries richer payment data (purpose, counterparty details, regulatory identifiers) than legacy SWIFT MT messages — enabling:

- **Straight-through processing rates** above 95% for cross-border transactions (vs. 60-70% with legacy messaging)
- **Compliance automation:** AML/sanctions screening can be automated when fields are structured rather than free-text
- **Agentic payment execution:** AI payment agents need structured data fields to initiate transactions reliably — ISO 20022's schema provides that foundation

**Finextra assessment (Feb 2026):** Domestic and cross-border payment systems are expected to increasingly unify in 2026, driven by ISO 20022 adoption and agentic AI handling the execution layer.

### Corporate Banking: ERP + Banking Convergence

**Andrea Baronchelli, CEO, Aspire (Singapore):**
> "Businesses will favour more integrated, software-driven financial platforms. Together, AI and digital money forces are giving rise to a new category of platforms that integrate payments, treasury, and financial operations into a single operating layer for businesses."

The convergence of ERP software with banking infrastructure — where a company's accounting system directly initiates payments, reconciles invoices, and manages FX hedges without a human touching a bank interface — is the corporate finance equivalent of the consumer agentic payment shift.

HSBC's **Tokenised Deposit Service** enables cross-border payments through blockchain-based infrastructure with 24/7 real-time settlement. For multinationals with SEA treasury operations, the ability to settle intra-company transfers at any hour without correspondent bank delays is a meaningful operational improvement.

## Part 4: Super-Apps and the Digital Wallet Ecosystem

### Sea Group: SeaMoney → Monee

Sea Limited (NYSE: SE, $104.47 as of Feb 25, 2026) has renamed its financial services arm from **SeaMoney** to **Monee**. The rename is more than cosmetic: it signals an attempt to position the digital financial services business as a standalone brand rather than a sub-feature of the Shopee e-commerce platform.

**Sea Group's three-pillar structure:**
- **Shopee** — e-commerce (dominant in SEA and Taiwan; retreating from Latin America and Europe)
- **Monee (formerly SeaMoney)** — digital payments, consumer lending, insurance, SME finance
- **Garena** — digital entertainment (Free Fire remains a major mobile game in SEA/LATAM)

**Sea's Q4 2025 trajectory:** Sea Limited's net income reportedly jumped 145% in a recent quarter (per TIKR analysis). The recovery from its 2022 cash burn crisis has been substantial — the company is now generating meaningful free cash flow. Monee is increasingly the growth driver, as Shopee's e-commerce margins compress in competitive markets.

### Grab Financial Group

Grab's financial services arm — **GrabPay, GXS Bank, and consumer lending** — remains the largest integrated digital financial platform in SEA by user base. GrabPay is deployed across ride-hailing, food delivery, and merchant payments in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

The WFM Asia BVI Ltd position of $201.56 million in Grab Holdings (as of Feb 27, 2026) reflects continued institutional interest in Grab's financial services upside — though Grab's stock remains well below its 2021 SPAC listing price, reflecting the slow path to consolidated profitability.

### GoTo / Bank Jago (Indonesia)

GoTo Group (merger of Gojek + Tokopedia) has the most compelling SEA super-app embedded finance story through its partnership with **Bank Jago**. The model: GoTo provides distribution (GoPay wallet, 300M+ transaction volume), Bank Jago provides the banking license, balance sheet, and lending infrastructure. The result is embedded credit and savings products that appear native within GoTo's super-app.

Bank Jago's trajectory — positive unit economics achieved faster than most regional peers — is the clearest proof-of-concept for the "distribute through an engaged platform first" approach that the Malaysian digital banking analysis identified as critical.

## Part 5: Regulatory Dynamics and Tightening Requirements

### Tightening Across the Region

Regulators in Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand have increased scrutiny across three dimensions (per Agora/FPT analysis, Feb 2026):

**1. Cybersecurity:** Requirements for penetration testing, incident response plans, and breach reporting timelines are tightening. Singapore's MAS Cyber Hygiene Notice (effective since 2019, updated 2024) requires banks to implement multi-factor authentication for privileged access and maintain offline backups — requirements that smaller digital banks have struggled to demonstrate compliance with at scale.

**2. Operational resilience:** After several high-profile digital banking outages in SEA (DBS Singapore's repeated 2023-2024 disruptions being the most prominent), regulators are requiring more rigorous business continuity testing and longer recovery time objective (RTO) guarantees.

**3. Consumer data protection:** Vietnam's Personal Data Protection Decree (effective September 2023), Indonesia's Personal Data Protection Law (2024 implementation), and Thailand's PDPA (effective 2022) are all being actively enforced, with increasing audit activity in 2025-2026.

**Impact on digital banks:** Compliance infrastructure is expensive. For a startup digital bank with a few hundred thousand customers, meeting the same compliance standards as an incumbent with millions of customers is a proportionally heavier cost burden. This is one structural reason digital bank unit economics remain challenged even when product metrics look healthy.

### Thailand's Virtual Bank Licensing Process

Thailand's Bank of Thailand (BOT) conducted a virtual bank licensing process in 2024-2025, with the first licenses expected to be awarded by 2025-2026. Applicants include major consortia from telecom, tech, and financial services sectors. The Thai market is significant: ~70M population, high smartphone penetration, PromptPay already deeply embedded in payment behavior, and traditional banks that — despite digital improvements — still have underserved segments in agriculture and informal economy.

## Part 6: The CBDC Dimension

### No ASEAN-Wide CBDC, But National Experiments Advancing

There is no imminent ASEAN-wide CBDC. But national central bank digital currency programs are advancing independently:

- **Thailand mBridge / retail CBDC:** Bank of Thailand is a participant in Project mBridge (along with China, UAE, Hong Kong) for cross-border wholesale CBDC settlement. Retail CBDC pilots have been conducted but no full-scale rollout is imminent.

- **Singapore Project Orchid:** MAS has been conducting purpose-bound money (PBM) experiments — CBDC-like programmable money for specific use cases (grants, welfare payments, vouchers). Government voucher schemes have run on this infrastructure.

- **Indonesia:** Bank Indonesia is developing a retail CBDC (Digital Rupiah) with a phased rollout targeting 2024-2026. Cross-border interoperability with regional CBDCs is a stated long-term objective.

**The practical question:** What does a CBDC add in a market where PromptPay already achieves instant settlement at near-zero cost for consumers? The answer may be primarily for programmability (conditional payments, automated disbursement of government benefits) and cross-border settlement efficiency rather than retail payment innovation.

## Outlook: What to Watch in Q2 2026

**Thailand Virtual Bank Awards:** If BOT awards virtual bank licenses in H1 2026, it will trigger the next SEA digital banking buildout cycle — another wave of tech-telecom-finance consortia investing in customer acquisition in a large, underpenetrated market.

**GoTo profitability milestone:** If GoTo Group achieves group-level profitability in 2026 (currently guided for it), the embedded finance + super-app model gets its most significant SEA validation yet.

**Agentic payment adoption:** Mastercard Agent Pay, TenPay Global's smart wallet, and other agentic commerce implementations will generate real usage data in 2026. The question is whether consumers actually prefer autonomous payment agents or whether trust and control preferences slow adoption below enterprise projections.

**Malaysia digital banking stabilization:** Post-leadership changes at Malaysian digital banks, 2026 is a prove-or-pivot year for the sector's viability. If the next wave of Malaysian digital bank CEOs can demonstrate positive unit economics by end of year, it validates the market. If not, the licensing experiment risks following the European neobank cautionary tale of high valuation → heavy losses → forced consolidation.

**ISO 20022 full migration:** SWIFT's deadline for cross-border ISO 20022 adoption is November 2025 (already passed, with transition period). 2026 is when the quality of that migration gets tested in real volumes — and when the benefits (or implementation gaps) become visible in settlement data.
