## Executive Summary

Climate tech in 2026 has crossed the threshold from "promising sector" to economic inevitability. The forces driving clean energy are no longer primarily ideological or policy-dependent — they are economic. Solar and battery storage costs continue falling to record lows, making clean power the cheapest option for most new electricity generation globally. Battery energy storage just hit **$70/kWh** (BloombergNEF 2026) — a new all-time low. Global clean energy investment surpassed **$2 trillion annually** for the first time. BESS installations hit **57 GWh / 28 GW** in 2025 (+29% YoY).

The defining 2026 paradox: **AI is simultaneously climate tech's biggest customer and its most powerful tool.** Data centers are driving unprecedented electricity demand growth — pushing up retail power prices in 39 of 50 US states — while AI is being deployed to optimise grid management, accelerate materials discovery, and reduce emissions at scale.

The sector has shifted from hype-and-moonshots to execution and measurable impact. Capital is more selective. Hydrogen has undergone a painful "pipeline cleanup." Nuclear — especially small modular reactors (SMRs) — is experiencing genuine investor enthusiasm. The global greentech market is projected to reach **€12 trillion by 2030**.

## 1. Solar + Battery: The Unstoppable Cost Curve

### Solar: Still Falling

Solar's levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) continues its multi-decade decline. In most major markets, new utility-scale solar is now the cheapest form of electricity generation — beating not just coal and gas, but also nuclear, geothermal, and offshore wind.

**2026 developments:**
- India rooftop solar hit record quarterly capacity — surpassing US in new Q3 installations for the first time
- Saudi Arabia surpassed UAE in total solar capacity deployed
- EU accelerating cross-border grid connections via new energy highway policy initiatives
- US solar topped 11.7 GW in Q3 2025 despite regulatory headwinds from the Trump administration — "government and/or utility policy restrictions cannot seem to slow down the market forces"

### Battery Storage: $70/kWh Record Low

The 2026 landmark: battery energy storage is now the **cheapest clean power segment** per BloombergNEF's LCOE 2026 report — even as most other clean tech costs rose (supply chain disruptions, permitting, labour).

**What $70/kWh enables:**
- Solar + storage paired installations now economically compelling for residential (California, Germany, Australia), commercial, and utility scale
- **EV charging stations**: China's CNTE has 100+ solar-powered fast-charging stations; solar bringing down mobility costs
- **Data centre on-site storage**: Peak load management without grid dependency; US, Europe, Asia deployments accelerating
- Aging battery asset management becoming a new maintenance/services market

**BESS installations 2025 (SEIA Q1 2026 report):**
- 57 GWh / 28 GW total US installations
- +29% YoY growth
- California, Texas, Arizona as top three markets
- Utility-scale underpinning growth (~50 GWh / 16 GW utility-scale)

**Wood Mackenzie forecast:** Battery energy storage investment holds at $20B in 2026 in real terms — "flat after jumping 50%" — as rapid cost declines offset volume growth in dollar terms.

## 2. The AI–Energy Nexus: Climate Tech's Defining Tension

### AI as Demand Driver

AI data centers are the largest new source of electricity demand growth in 2026:
- **39 of 50 US states** saw real increases in residential electricity rates in 2025 — driven largely by data centre load growth
- Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Meta) are the largest corporate buyers of clean energy globally
- The 2026 data center energy conversation is shifting: **from securing supply → to resilience and decoupling from the grid** (Toyota Ventures)

Data centers are increasingly deploying on-site solar + battery storage to:
- Avoid grid instability during peak demand
- Reduce wholesale electricity price exposure
- Address public and regulatory pushback from communities seeing rising bills

### Nuclear: The Data Center Power Play

Nuclear power has become the preferred long-term solution for data centers needing 24/7 carbon-free power:

**SMR (Small Modular Reactor) boom:**
- Nuclear startups raised **>$1 billion in rounds** in Q4 2025 alone — leading to SPAC/IPO speculation for 2026
- "Nuclear everything is in vogue right now" — Kyle Teamey, RA Capital
- Key players: **NuScale Power**, **Kairos Power** (Google PPA signed), **TerraPower** (Bill Gates), **Commonwealth Fusion Systems** (SPARC tokamak), **Oklo** (Sam Altman-backed)

**Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs):**
- Microsoft signed deal to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 (Constellation Energy) — the first restart of a shuttered US nuclear plant for corporate clean power
- Google signed PPA with Kairos Power for SMR electricity delivery by 2030
- Amazon investing in multiple nuclear projects through its Climate Pledge initiative

**Why nuclear for data centers:**
- 24/7 carbon-free generation (solar/wind are intermittent)
- Density: small land footprint relative to output
- Long-duration contracts (20–40 years) match data center asset lifespans
- Regulatory credibility: PPAs from hyperscalers give SMR developers bankable offtake

**Timeline reality check:** SMRs are not generating power in 2026. Commercial deployment is 2029–2035. The investment wave is real; the electricity is not yet. Solar + batteries remain the **near-term** data center power solution.

### AI as Climate Tool

AI is being deployed across the climate value chain:

| Application | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Grid optimisation** | ML-based demand forecasting + dispatch; reduces curtailment of renewables |
| **Materials discovery** | AI accelerating battery chemistry R&D (solid-state, sodium-ion, iron-air) |
| **Carbon capture optimisation** | Process efficiency ML for direct air capture (DAC) and point-source capture |
| **Climate modelling** | Foundation models for weather/climate prediction (Google DeepMind GraphCast, Nvidia FourCastNet) |
| **Building efficiency** | AI-driven HVAC and energy management; 15–25% energy savings |
| **Agriculture** | Precision irrigation, yield prediction, soil carbon monitoring |
| **EV fleet management** | AI charge scheduling to minimise grid stress and costs |

Google DeepMind's **GraphCast** weather model (2023) predicts 10-day global weather patterns in under 60 seconds — previously a 6-hour compute job. Accurate long-range forecasting is critical for grid operators managing high-penetration renewables.

## 3. Investment Landscape 2026: Execution Over Experimentation

### The Overall Picture

Climate tech investment proved resilient in 2025 despite the Trump administration dismantling Biden-era IRA incentives:
- **US + EU venture bets essentially flat vs 2024** (CTVC) — far better than bears predicted
- The resilience factor: **clean energy is now cheaper than alternatives in most cases** — economic logic supersedes policy
- Global clean energy investment record: **>$2 trillion annually**

### Where Capital Is Flowing

**Winners:**
- Solar + battery storage (cost-driven; immediate ROI)
- Grid infrastructure and transmission (critical bottleneck)
- Nuclear (data center / hyperscaler demand signal)
- Industrial decarbonisation (cement, steel, chemicals — "hard to abate" sectors)
- Climate adaptation and resilience (insurance, flood protection, water)
- Carbon removal (direct air capture, enhanced weathering, biochar)

**Challenged sectors:**
- **Green hydrogen:** Undergoing "pipeline cleanup" — early announcements lacked offtake certainty, infrastructure clarity, or bankable economics. Hundreds of billions in announced projects are being quietly abandoned. Green hydrogen remains strategically important for hard-to-decarbonise sectors (shipping, aviation, fertilisers) but the timeline has extended significantly.
- Early-stage climate moonshots: More selective capital, demand for de-risked assets with clear commercial line-of-sight

### Corporate Venture Capital Rising

In the gap left by cautious VC markets, **corporate venture capital (CVC)** is stepping in:
- Corporations leveraging domain expertise to identify strategic opportunities
- Industrial partnerships with founders replacing pure VC rounds
- ICL Group, Siemens Energy Ventures, Shell Ventures, Total Energies Ventures — all active
- This signals the **mainstreaming of climate tech** as national industrial policy

## 4. Energy Geopolitics 2026: A Volatile Backdrop

**Wood Mackenzie's five themes:**

**Oil:** OPEC+ strategy to dampen non-OPEC supply by driving prices down is working. **Brent forecast: $59/bbl in 2026** (-$10 vs 2025). Global liquids supply growth (2.5M b/d) overwhelms demand growth (0.7M b/d).

**LNG:** Global LNG enters a long-duration price slump. Massive US and Qatar LNG supply ramps through 2026. European TTF already below $10/mmbtu in early January despite cold weather — could halve again by early 2030s.

**Metals:** **Copper** stands out — electrification demand growth + supply disruptions buoy prices. Critical mineral supply chain security becomes a national strategic priority. Governments building domestic supply chains for lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earths.

**Trade polarisation:** Global trade increasingly bifurcating into US-led and China-led blocs. China manufactures ~80% of global solar panels and dominates battery supply chains — a significant geopolitical leverage point.

**GDP:** Global GDP growth slows to 2.5% in 2026 from 2.8% (Wood Mackenzie) as trade tariffs bite.

## 5. Emerging Technologies to Watch

### Solid-State Batteries

The next frontier beyond lithium-ion:
- Higher energy density, faster charging, no liquid electrolyte (safer, longer-lasting)
- Toyota: expects solid-state EV battery in production vehicle by 2027–2028
- Samsung SDI, CATL, QuantumScape: all active with commercial timelines

### Sodium-Ion Batteries

CATL commercialising sodium-ion for grid storage and lower-cost EVs:
- No lithium, cobalt, or nickel — breaks supply chain dependency
- Lower energy density than Li-ion, but sufficient for stationary storage and urban EVs
- Dramatically cheaper at scale: sodium is one of Earth's most abundant elements

### Iron-Air Batteries (Long-Duration Storage)

**Form Energy** deploying 100-hour iron-air batteries for grid storage — solving the intermittency problem of renewables at multi-day timescales. First commercial deployments underway. $400M+ raised.

### Enhanced Geothermal

**Quaise Energy, Fervo Energy:** AI-guided drilling for geothermal anywhere (not just volcanic regions). Fervo's Utah project now delivering 24/7 clean power to Google. "Geothermal everywhere" is a 2030s thesis being built now.

### Direct Air Capture (DAC)

**Climeworks** (Switzerland) and **Heirloom Carbon** (US) operating commercial DAC facilities. Current cost: ~$400–$1,000/tonne CO₂. Target: <$100/tonne for scale. US DOE funding $3.5B for 4 regional DAC hubs.

## 6. EV Market: Past the Tipping Point in Key Regions

Global EV adoption is past the tipping point in several major markets:

| Market | EV Share of New Sales | Trend |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| Norway | ~90%+ | Saturation approaching |
| China | ~35–40% | Rapid growth; CATL/BYD dominating |
| EU average | ~20–25% | Mandate-driven; 2035 ICE ban (softening) |
| US | ~8–10% | Slower; policy uncertainty post-IRA rollbacks |
| India | ~4–6% | Rapid growth from low base; 2W/3W leading |
| Southeast Asia | ~3–5% | Early adoption; Chinese brands dominant |

**Battery cost → EV price parity:** At $70/kWh battery pack, mass-market EV-to-ICE price parity is achievable at scale. The remaining barrier: charging infrastructure (particularly rural US and Southeast Asia).

**Chinese EV brands:** BYD, NIO, Xpeng, Li Auto — dominating in China, expanding aggressively in Southeast Asia, Europe, and Australia. Facing tariffs in US (100%+) and EU (additional 17–35%).
