## Summary

AI-driven data centers are consuming vast amounts of power and water, raising concerns about grid reliability, water scarcity, and community impacts. Recent reports highlight that even mid-sized data centers use as much water as small towns, while large facilities can consume up to 5 million gallons per day—equivalent to a city of 50,000 people.

## Key Findings

- **Water Usage:** Data centers require massive cooling, drawing from local water supplies. This is becoming a hidden constraint on AI expansion, particularly in water-stressed regions.
- **Energy Demand:** AI workloads spike electricity demand, threatening household price increases and grid stability. The White House is drafting agreements to mitigate these impacts.
- **Regional Impact:** Projects in Virginia, Michigan, Arizona, and elsewhere face scrutiny over water depletion and energy strain. Local communities often bear the cost.
- **Policy Response:** Comprehensive coordination among tech companies, governments, and utilities is needed to balance economic development with resource sustainability.

## Implications

- Future AI infrastructure must integrate water reuse, renewable energy, and efficient cooling to avoid exacerbating scarcity.
- Regulatory frameworks may emerge to cap consumption or require offsets.
- Tech firms are likely to face increased ESG pressure regarding resource usage.

## Next Steps

- Track state-level legislation on data center resource usage.
- Monitor advances in liquid cooling and air-cooled AI chips.
- Investigate case studies of data center water recycling successes.
