# Japan–China Anime Co‑Production Shifts: Geopolitical Risk Update 2026

**Research Report** — 2026‑02‑21  
Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM (Geopolitical risk to anime revenue streams)  
Scope: Regulatory changes, co‑production treaties, platform partnerships (Bilibili vs Tencent vs iQIYI)

---

## Executive Summary

The Japan–China anime relationship is at an inflection point:

- **Official push:** Governments agreed (Dec 2024) to fast‑track a co‑production Memorandum of Understanding, promising “preferential treatment” and quota exemptions for joint works.
- **Reality check:** China Film Administration **froze approvals of new Japanese movies** in November 2025, with at least six previously approved titles postponed indefinitely.
- **Platform strategies:** Bilibili and Tencent continue to invest in co‑productions (e.g., *To Be Hero X* with Aniplex, *Hana no Ko Lunlun* with Toei), but the regulatory environment remains opaque.
- **Rising competition:** Chinese Donghua is expanding, threatening Japan’s market dominance as the global anime market is forecast to double from $38B (2025) to $89.7B (2030).

**Bottom line:** Co‑production treaties offer a path around China’s foreign film quota, but implementation is stalled by political tensions. Revenue exposure to China is at risk; studios should diversify distribution and monitor policy signals closely.

## 1. Co‑Production Treaties: Promise vs Practice

### The 2018 Japan–China Film Co‑Production Agreement

- Signed in 2018, the agreement theoretically allows co‑productions to bypass China’s annual foreign film quota (which limits imported movies to 34 screens per year, with revenue caps).
- Preferential treatment includes streamlined approvals and full revenue repatriation for co‑production works.
- **However:** As of 2023, **zero films** had been produced specifically under this agreement (Shikoku News, Jan 2023). Bureaucratic hurdles and mutual distrust have prevented activation.

### December 2024 High‑Level Dialogue

- Japan’s FM Takeshi Iwaya and China’s FM Wang Yi met (Dec 25, 2024) at the Second Japan‑China High‑Level People‑to‑People and Cultural Exchange Dialogue.
- Both sides agreed to:
  - **Prioritize signing** the Japan‑China Memorandum of Understanding on co‑production of audiovisual works.
  - Promote cooperation under the existing Film Co‑Production Agreement.
  - Improve transparency of foreign content regulations in China.
  - Strengthen anti‑piracy measures.
- The MoU focuses on animation, drama, and documentary co‑productions for broadcasting and distribution.

### Status: Fast‑Track But Unrealized

Despite the diplomatic push, concrete progress is lacking. The China Film Administration’s freeze on Japanese movie approvals (Nov 2025) suggests that political tensions are outweighing co‑production goodwill.

## 2. The November 2025 Freeze: A Major Setback

**Event:** The China Film Administration halted approvals of new Japanese movies in November 2025. At least six titles already approved were postponed indefinitely (The Japan Times, Nov 27, 2025).

**Implications:**
- **Licensing revenue disruption:** Japanese studios rely on China for 20–30% of overseas revenue (pre‑COVID peaks). A freeze directly impacts cash flow.
- **Co‑production pipeline stall:** Even joint projects may face scrutiny; Chinese partners may hesitate to commit.
- **Market sentiment:** Negative signal to investors; could accelerate Donghua (Chinese animation) growth relative to imported anime.

**Possible drivers:**
- Ongoing territorial disputes and historical tensions.
- China’s desire to boost domestic content (Donghua) and reduce reliance on Japanese imports.
- Retaliatory measures for unrelated diplomatic issues.

## 3. Platform Partnerships: Who’s Investing?

Despite regulatory headwinds, major Chinese platforms continue to court Japanese studios:

### Bilibili

- **Strategic alliance:** Historic partnership with Funimation (2019) for mutual licensing; still active.
- **Co‑production investments:** Participated in *To Be Hero X* (Aniplex) and co‑development deals with Japanese studios.
- **International expansion:** Bilibili now available in multiple markets, licensing anime globally while pushing into China.
- **Sony stake:** Sony holds a minority stake in Bilibili, facilitating deeper ties.

### Tencent

- **Direct investments:** Tencent has acquired stakes in Japanese studios like Kadokawa (Outlook India, Nov 2025).
- **Co‑production:** *Hana no Ko Lunlun* reboot (Toei Animation) is a Japan–China co‑production with Tencent Video as the Chinese partner.
- **Streaming power:** Tencent Video is a major anime licensor in China; pushes for exclusive simulcasts.

### iQIYI

- Less visible in co‑production news but remains a major buyer of Japanese anime rights.
- Focus on domestic animation (Donghua) to reduce licensing costs.

**Pattern:** Platforms are using equity stakes and co‑production to secure content pipelines, betting that regulatory issues will eventually ease.

## 4. Donghua Competition: The Rising Threat

- **Market forecasts:** Global anime market to reach $89.7B by 2030 (from $38B in 2025). Chinese Donghua is capturing a growing share domestically and expanding overseas.
- **Investment:** Chinese tech giants (Tencent, Alibaba) are funding Donghua studios, creating alternatives to Japanese imports.
- **Policy support:** Chinese government encourages local content creation; quotas and subsidies favor Donghua.
- **Impact:** Even if the Japan–China co‑production treaty were fully activated, competition from homegrown animation could limit upside for Japanese studios.

## 5. Revenue Exposure and Strategic Implications

### Quantifying Risk

- Pre‑2020, China accounted for ~25% of Japanese anime overseas revenue (DPA reports).
- The 2020–2022 COVID period and subsequent regulatory tightening have reduced this share.
- The November 2025 freeze could push the share below 15% in the short term.

### Mitigation Strategies for Studios

1. **Diversify distribution:** Increase reliance on North America (Crunchyroll, Netflix) and Europe (Manga Entertainment, Wakanim).
2. **Co‑production with non‑Chinese partners:** South Korea, Taiwan, Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Thailand) offer growth without quota restrictions.
3. **Leverage streaming direct‑to‑consumer:** Netflix’s global rollout reduces regional gatekeepers; studios can license directly.
4. **Monitor diplomatic signals:** The co‑production MoU signing would be a positive catalyst; its absence suggests continued risk.

---

## 6. Monitoring Checklist

- **Regulatory:** China Film Administration approval timelines; any lifting of the freeze.
- **Diplomatic:** Signing of the Japan–China Audiovisual Works Co‑production MoU.
- **Platform deals:** New Bilibili/Tencent co‑production announcements; investment in Japanese studios.
- **Market data:** Quarterly revenue breakdown by region from major anime producers (Aniplex, Toei, TMS, ufotable).
- **Donghua growth:** International licensing revenue for Chinese animation (Baidu, Tencent Donghua exports).
