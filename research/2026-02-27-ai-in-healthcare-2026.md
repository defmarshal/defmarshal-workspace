## 1. AI Adoption — Crossing the Chasm

NVIDIA’s 2026 survey reveals widespread deployment across healthcare segments:

- **Digital healthcare**: 78% using AI  
- **Medical technology**: 74%  
- **Pharma/biotech**: strong growth  
- **Payers/providers**: 65%+ adoption

Top workloads:
1. Generative AI/LLMs — 69%
2. AI for data analytics/data science — second
3. Predictive analytics — third
4. Agentic AI — fourth (47% using/assessing)

Dr. Annabelle Painter (Visiba U.K.) notes: “Scaling generative AI in healthcare starts with focusing on real clinical and operational problems, rather than the technology itself. The organizations seeing impact are those that embed AI into existing workflows instead of layering AI on top as a separate tool.”

## 2. Clinical Applications — Imaging, Decision Support, Workflow

### Medical Imaging

- 61% of medical technology respondents use AI for medical imaging (e.g., radiologists using AI to work more quickly and efficiently).
- 57% of medtech segment reports ROI from AI in medical imaging.

### Clinical Decision Support

- Top industry use case: clinical decision support — radiologists highlight areas of concern on scans.
- Workflow optimization is another top use case.

### Epic Curiosity AI

Epic launched Curiosity — a family of generative AI models trained on Cosmos (300M+ deidentified patient records) — marking a shift from narrow tools to generative, predictive systems that understand the full patient health journey.

- **Training**: Structured medical events (diagnoses, medications, lab results) over time.
- **Sequence-based approach**: Predicts future clinical events by learning event sequences.
- **Use cases**: Chronic disease management, differential diagnosis, hospital operations (capacity/staffing).
- **Integration**: Seamlessly within Epic EHR; Aura bridges external diagnostics into clinician dashboard.
- **Availability**: Feb 2026 to Cosmos research community; includes visualization tools for exploring patient trajectories.
- **Ethics**: Trained on deidentified data; peer-reviewed research first.

## 3. Drug Discovery — From Pilot to AI-Native Platform

Benchling’s 2026 Biotech AI Report shows the sector moving into a “builder” phase: companies are reshaping data environments and org structures to make AI a default part of R&D.

### Early‑Stage Acceleration

- **50%** of AI adopters report faster time-to-target.
- **42%** see uplift in accuracy and hit rates with scientific models.
- Predictive models lead adoption: protein structure prediction (73% of leaders), docking models (52%).
- AI couples design with lab (wet‑dry integration) to shrink discovery timelines from years to months.

### Infrastructure Bottlenecks

Adoption drops in complex domains:
- Generative design: 42%
- Biomarker analysis: 40%
- ADME prediction: 29%

Primary blocker: **data environment** — information across many systems, missing metadata. **55%** cite poor data quality/availability as #1 reason AI pilots fail.

**Solution**: Invest in “prospective data” — high-quality, well‑annotated measurements. Leaders with high AI adoption are nearly twice as likely to have strong wet‑dry lab integration (30% vs 18%).

## 4. Generative AI in Research — Speed and Oversight

UCSF/Wayne State study (published Feb 17 in Cell Reports Medicine) tested generative AI on preterm birth prediction using data from 1,200+ pregnant women across three DREAM challenges.

- **8 AI chatbots** given natural language prompts to generate analysis code.
- **4 produced usable models**; some matched or exceeded human team performance.
- **Timeline**: From inception to journal submission took 6 months (vs. nearly 2 years to consolidate DREAM human results).
- **Outcome**: AI generated code in minutes; junior researchers (master’s student + high schooler) achieved comparable results to seasoned teams.
- **Caution**: AI can produce misleading results; human expertise remains essential for validation.

Marina Sirota (UCSF): “The speed‑up couldn’t come sooner for patients who need help now.”

## 5. Regulatory Landscape — FDA and Mental Health AI

TechPolicy.Press notes: **FDA has not approved any device using generative AI for mental health** as of early 2026, though at least two have received “breakthrough device designation” to accelerate review.

This reflects a cautious approach: regulatory pathways for generative AI in high‑stakes, subjective domains (mental health assessments) are still being defined.

---

## 6. Talent — The Rise of the Scientific Translator

Drug Discovery News highlights a fundamental talent shift:

- **67%** of biotech orgs upskill existing scientific staff in AI (internal talent development).
- Only **21%** hire from tech companies.
- **Why?** Need for “scientific translators” who understand biology, regulatory requirements, and machine learning.

Organizational models:
- **30%** place AI leadership inside R&D.
- **35%** adopt hybrid: centralized AI group + embedded specialists.

Proximity to the bench reduces handoffs and ensures AI tools fit real experiments.

---

## 7. Open Source and Interoperability

NVIDIA survey: **82%** say open source software/models are moderately to extremely important to AI strategy.

John Nosta (NostaLab): “Open models will shape the intellectual field… Discovery will be open, and deployment will demand stewardship.”

This dual approach: use open source for exploration; rely on proprietary systems for validated, integrated clinical deployment.

---

## 8. ROI and Investment Trends

- **85%** of respondents said AI helps increase revenue; **80%** said it reduces costs.
- **85%** plan AI budget increases in 2026; **46%** will increase >10%; **23%** expect to double or more.
- Investment moving to data infrastructure and scientific modeling capabilities.

---

## 9. Agentic AI in Healthcare — Emerging Use

NVIDIA survey: **47%** using or assessing agentic AI. Applications include:
- Knowledge retrieval automation
- Research paper analysis
- Coordinating experiments end‑to‑end
- Clinical workflow orchestration

---

## 10. Future Outlook

- **AI‑native discovery systems**: Closed‑loop cycles where digital models and lab experiments continuously inform each other.
- **Clinical integration**: Generative AI becomes a seamless layer within EHRs (Epic Curiosity as bellwether).
- **Regulatory evolution**: FDA pathways for generative AI in mental health and other high‑risk areas will crystallize.
- **Talent development**: Scientific translator roles become standardized; AI literacy becomes baseline for researchers and clinicians.
- **Data infrastructure**: Organizations invest heavily in prospective, well‑annotated data collection; wet‑dry lab integration differentiates leaders.
- **Open‑closed balance**: Open models for research; hardened proprietary platforms for clinical care.

## Conclusion

Healthcare AI in 2026 is no longer speculative — it’s delivering revenue growth, cost savings, faster discoveries, and better patient outcomes. The pioneers are those who embed AI into real workflows, invest in data quality, upskill scientific talent, and choose the right mix of open and proprietary tools. The next chapter is about scaling these integrated systems across the care continuum and the R&D pipeline, with AI as a default operating layer.
