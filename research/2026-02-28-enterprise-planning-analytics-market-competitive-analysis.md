## Deployment & Implementation Trends

### Cloud vs On-Premises

- **Cloud deployments** grew 47% YoY; now 60% of new adopters choose cloud
- **Average time-to-value:**
  - Cloud: 8–9 weeks (from contract to production)
  - On-premises: 6–9 months (including infrastructure setup)
- **Hybrid models** persist in regulated industries (banking, government, healthcare) where data residency or compliance requirements prevent full cloud migration.

### Implementation Resource Requirements

- **Anaplan:** One G2 reviewer noted need for "one person practically full-time to maintain and update models" post-launch.
- **IBM PA:** Requires TM1 modeling expertise; ongoing tuning and subset management critical for performance.
- **Workday & Anaplan:** Generally faster initial setup; ongoing admin overhead varies by model complexity.
- **Implementation partners:** Major systems integrators (Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, EY) dominate enterprise deployments; boutique consultancies serve mid-market.

## Selection Criteria for Buyers

When evaluating EPM platforms, organizations should weigh:

1. **Deployment model fit:** Cloud (speed, lower upfront cost) vs hybrid/on-prem (control, compliance)
2. **Integration ecosystem:** Native connectors to ERP (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft), HR systems, BI tools
3. **User skill profile:** Power-user centric (IBM PA, Anaplan) vs broad end-user adoption (Workday)
4. **Model complexity:** High-volume, calculation-intensive (favor TM1) vs scenario-driven planning (Anaplan, Workday)
5. **Total cost of ownership:** License + infrastructure + implementation + ongoing admin staff
6. **Vendor roadmap:** AI integration pace, SaaS vs hybrid investment balance
7. **Industry vertical needs:** BFSI (consolidation, compliance), manufacturing (supply chain), retail (merchandising), healthcare (resource planning)

---

## Future Outlook (2026–2035)

### AI & Automation

- **AI/ML integration** increased 47% YoY; expect predictive forecasting, anomaly detection, and natural language query to become table stakes.
- **Agentic workflows:** Autonomous data ingestion, variance commentary generation, and scenario recommendation emerging in leading platforms.
- **MCP adoption:** IBM pushing Model Context Protocol to enable orchestration and custom AI integrations.

### Cloud-First, But Not Cloud-Only

- Cloud-first development but hybrid remains for regulated industries; expect continued investment in robust on-prem/private cloud offerings.
- **Average cloud deployment time** expected to shrink further (target: 4–6 weeks) as templated solutions mature.

### SME Market Expansion

- SMEs currently 30–35% of deployments; growing fastest in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, MEA.
- Vendors are introducing tiered pricing, simplified configurations, and low-code modeling to capture this segment.

### Regulatory & ESG

- **ESG reporting modules** now included in 38–40% of new EPM releases; driven by EU CSRD, ISSB, and SEC climate disclosure rules.
- Expect tighter integration between financial planning and ESG metrics.

## Recommendations for Organizations

1. **Conduct proof-of-concept (PoC)** with 2–3 finalists using your actual data and processes. Avoid vendor-managed demos with sanitized data.
2. **Calculate 5-year TCO** including implementation, infrastructure (if on-prem/hybrid), admin staff, and license escalation.
3. **Evaluate AI roadmap** — does the vendor's AI strategy align with your intended use cases (forecasting, commentary, anomaly detection)?
4. **Check reference customers** in your industry and of similar size; ask about admin overhead and hidden costs.
5. **Consider future state:** If you anticipate hybridcloud or full cloud migration, ensure the platform supports both without re-architecting models.

## Conclusion

The EPM market in 2026 is characterized by **cloud dominance, AI infusion, and vendor fragmentation**. IBM Planning Analytics offers a powerful but complex solution best suited for large, regulated enterprises with sophisticated planning needs and existing IBM relationships. Alternatives like Anaplan (agility), Workday (UX, workforce), and Oracle (consolidation, Oracle stack) compete strongly in their niches. The "right" choice depends less on absolute capabilities and more on organizational fit — deployment preferences, skill availability, integration landscape, and total cost of ownership.
