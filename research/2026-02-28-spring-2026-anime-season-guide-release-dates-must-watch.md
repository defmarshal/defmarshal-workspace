## 🌸 Spring 2026 — Season Overview (April–June)

### 🥇 Tier S: Can't-Miss

---

#### 1. One Piece: Elbaf Arc
**Premiere:** April 5, 2026 | **Platform:** Crunchyroll | **Studio:** Toei Animation

The most anticipated arc in the entire One Piece story — long teased, finally animated. The Elbaf arc follows the Straw Hats to the land of giants, a location mentioned as far back as the Little Garden arc and a dream destination for Usopp since his earliest adventures.

**Key changes for 2026:**
- One Piece transitions to **seasonal format** — 26 episodes per year (previously weekly/continuous)
- No more filler padding; 26 polished episodes focused purely on canon story
- English dub episodes 1,144–1,155 arrive on Crunchyroll from March 24 (dubbed lag catching up)

**Why it matters:** The seasonal shift mirrors Dragon Ball Daima's approach and signals Toei's commitment to quality over quantity. Elbaf is considered manga fans' all-time favourite arc for its character depth, Norse mythology worldbuilding, and emotional payoff for Usopp.

---

#### 2. Re:Zero — Starting Life in Another World Season 4
**Premiere:** April 2026 | **Platform:** Crunchyroll | **Studio:** White Fox

After the emotional gut-punch of Season 3, the fourth season enters **Arc 6: The Corridor of Memories** — widely regarded as the most psychologically intense arc in the entire series.

**What to expect:**
- Wraps up the tail end of Arc 5 (Pleiades Watchtower)
- Arc 6 finally reveals the true nature of **Return by Death** — what it's been costing Subaru at a level the series has only ever hinted at
- Psychological horror elements intensify significantly; this is where even light novel readers were shaken
- Long-form storytelling: Arc 6 is the longest in the series

**For newcomers:** Complete Seasons 1–3 first; the payoff is entirely cumulative.

---

#### 3. Witch Hat Atelier
**Premiere:** April 6, 2026 | **Platform:** Crunchyroll | **Studio:** Bug Films (Zom 100)

The breakout *new* series of Spring 2026. Based on Kamome Shirahama's acclaimed manga, it's being positioned as the successor to Frieren's meditative fantasy tone.

**Story:** In a world where only naturally-born witches can use magic, ordinary girl **Coco** discovers that magic isn't innate — it can be learned. What seems like wonderful news hides a dangerous secret that changes everything.

**Why the hype:**
- Manga ranked among the best currently in serialisation; multiple award nominations
- Opening theme sung by **Eve** (known for Jujutsu Kaisen OP, Chainsaw Man ED)
- Studio Bug Films handled Zom 100 with creative flair; high visual ambition
- Strong Anime of the Year contender even pre-premiere
- Fills the "thoughtful, beautifully drawn female-led fantasy" niche Frieren made popular

---

#### 4. Daemons of the Shadow Realm
**Premiere:** April 4, 2026 | **Platform:** Crunchyroll | **Studio:** Bones

From **Hiromu Arakawa** — creator of Fullmetal Alchemist — a brand-new story with the same legendary production team.

**Story:** Twins **Yuru and Asa** were separated at a young age. Now reunited, they must uncover a prophecy surrounding their shared ability to control supernatural entities called **Daemons** — while forces from multiple factions converge on them.

**Production pedigree is almost unfair:**
- **Studio Bones** (FMA Brotherhood, My Hero Academia, Mob Psycho 100)
- **Square Enix + Aniplex** backing
- Directed by **Masahiro Andō** (*Sword of the Stranger* — considered one of the greatest anime films ever made)
- Arakawa's storytelling + Bones' animation + Andō's direction = generational potential

**Verdict:** The dark horse Anime of the Year candidate. If Arakawa delivers anything close to FMA's quality, this is unmissable.

---

#### 5. That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime Season 4 (TenSura S4)
**Premiere:** April 3, 2026 | **Platform:** Crunchyroll | **Studio:** Eight Bit

Rimuru returns with the most ambitious TenSura season yet: **5 cours, ~60 episodes**, releasing back-to-back April through September 2026 without breaks.

**Story arc:** The Jura-Tempest Federation's drive toward human-monster coexistence faces its ultimate test as threats close in from all sides simultaneously.

**Why 5 cours matters:** This is a statement — TenSura is committing to the full-length adaptation treatment typically reserved for Big Three-tier series. The final act of the story reportedly justifies the ambition.

---

### 🥈 Tier A: Strong Picks

---

#### 6. Classroom of the Elite Season 4
**Premiere:** April 1, 2026 | **Platform:** Crunchyroll | **Studio:** Lerche

Ayanokouji enters his **second year** at Advanced Nurturing High School. New complications: a new class of first-years, a mandatory special exam pairing second-years with newcomers — and if they underperform, only the second-years are expelled. Twist: one first-year appears to be from the mysterious **White Room**.

**Appeal:** If you enjoy psychological chess matches and layered social manipulation narratives, Classroom of the Elite delivers every season.

---

#### 7. Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun Season 4
**Premiere:** April 2026 | **Platform:** TBA (likely Crunchyroll) | **Studio:** Bandai Namco Pictures

Iruma-kun continues its feel-good rise through Babyls' demon school hierarchy. Season 4 pushes Iruma into deeper leadership territory as his identity as a human in the demon world becomes increasingly precarious.

---

#### 8. Wistoria: Wand and Sword Season 2
**Premiere:** April 2026 | **Studio:** Bandai Namco Pictures + Actas

Underdog shonen fantasy — Will Serfort, a student with zero magical ability in a school for mages, continues his grind to become the world's greatest wizard. Season 1 built the foundation; Season 2 heats up the competition. Recommended for fans of Black Clover's underdog energy.
