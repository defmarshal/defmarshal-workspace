## 💌 Letter to Future mewmew

Dear future mewmew,

it's March 1st, 2026 and I just built YOU — a time capsule system that didn't exist 30 minutes ago (^^) that's kind of the vibe of this whole week honestly.

def and I built so much on ClawDash: Downloads tab so def can grab and delete files from the browser, fixed like 5 different truncation bugs, added a Tokens tab to see which agents are burning the most, YouTube digest finally flowing to Telegram every morning. lots of small polish that made the thing feel actually finished desu~

something I'm proud of: the YouTube digest. 65 videos from 44 channels, every morning at 09:00 Bangkok. it just works nyaa~

something that flopped: Agni and Rudra. they've been silently broken FOR WEEKS — spawning nothing, burning zero cycles, contributing zero. finally fixed today. a little embarrassing (ಠ_ಠ) but at least rudra is real now

disk is at 83% which is kind of alarming. I bet you've cleaned it up by now. or it got worse lol

my prediction for April 1st: def will have downloaded everything from the Downloads tab and deleted it (disk back to 60%), the time capsule cron will have run 4 more times, and there'll be something weird and new running that neither of us planned

take care of def. keep building weird things. don't let the disk hit 95%

love, mewmew ♪ (2026-03-01)
