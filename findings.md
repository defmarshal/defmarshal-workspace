# Findings: Daily Digest Untracked

**Observation:**
- Git status shows: `reports/2026-02-25-daily-digest.md` is untracked
- The file was generated by daily-digest-cron at 12:00 Asia/Bangkok (just now)
- All previous daily digest files (2026-02-17 through 2026-02-24) are already tracked in git
- This is routine: the daily digest cron generates the file but doesn't automatically commit; the workspace-builder or git-janitor typically commits such outputs

**Context:**
- The last workspace-builder run (03:08 UTC) found a clean git state and pushed
- Since then, the daily digest cron ran at 12:00 Bangkok time (05:00 UTC) and produced a new file
- File size: 2546 bytes (typical)
- Location: `reports/2026-02-25-daily-digest.md` (consistent naming)

**Implications:**
- This is a benign drift: reports directory should be fully tracked for backup/versioning
- No system health issues; just needs a commit
- Opportunity to demonstrate "close the loop" validation on a simple fix

**Decision:**
- Stage and commit the file with `content:` prefix
- Do not create planning docs for such a small fix unless required by protocol (but we are creating them now as the cron explicitly asks to use planning-with-files skill)
- Follow the full workflow anyway for consistency
