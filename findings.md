## Current State Assessment

### System Health
- **Git:** Clean except for untracked research artifact in `apps/research-hub/public/research/`
- **Disk:** 66% used (healthy)
- **Gateway:** Healthy
- **Memory:** Local FTS+ clean (22/22 files, 182 chunks)
- **Active tasks:** Well-maintained (<2KB)

### Identified Issues

#### 1. Untracked Research Artifacts
- `apps/research-hub/public/research/2026-02-23-quantum-computing-commercialization-2026-outlook.md` (and .mp3) exist but untracked.
- These are generated by research agent and synced via `prebuild.sh` from `/research/` (tracked).
- They should be tracked as part of Research Hub's static site assets for deployment consistency.

#### 2. Stale Idea Branches
Two feature branches remain from recent executor runs:
- `idea/add-a-new-quick-utility` (executed and rejected 2026-02-23 10:07 UTC)
- `idea/write-a-rudra-safe-fix-pattern` (executed and validated success 2026-02-23 09:15 UTC)
- Both should be deleted after executor finishes to keep branch namespace clean.

#### 3. MEMORY.md Line Count Exceeds Target
- Current: 34 lines. Target: ≤30 lines for long-term memory conciseness.
- Needs condensation without losing key learnings.

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Track research artifacts:** `git add` the untracked files in `public/research/`. They are valid published content and should be versioned with the site.
2. **Delete stale branches:** After ensuring no pending work, remove both idea branches locally.
3. **Condense MEMORY.md:** Merge recent learnings into tighter bullet points, preserve dates and key patterns.
4. **Update planning files:** Reflect this session in `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`.
5. **Close the loop:** Run health check, verify no temp files, ensure active-tasks.md updated, push commits with `build:` prefix.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Accidentally deleting a branch that's still needed. Mitigation: Verify latest.json shows both ideas as `executed: true` and `validated: true` (or rejected) before deletion.
- Risk: Over-trimming MEMORY.md. Mitigation: Keep essential metadata and 4-5 latest learning bullets; older patterns remain in `lessons.md`.

### Validation Criteria
- `./quick health` returns OK
- active-tasks.md < 2KB
- MEMORY.md ≤30 lines
- No leftover untracked research files (all tracked)
- No idea branches remain (only `master` and feature branches from active generator cycles)
- All commits pushed to origin
