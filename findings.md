# Workspace Builder Findings

**Session:** 23dad379-21ad-4f7a-8c68-528f98203a33
**Date:** 2026-02-22 09:00 UTC

## Current Situation

- Workspace health is excellent: Disk 64%, Memory clean (21f/112c), Gateway healthy, no pending updates, git clean.
- Previous builder run (05:00-07:00) completed successfully; all artifacts committed and pushed.
- **Unhealthy state detected**: The repository has a **stale feature branch** that should be removed:
  - Branch: `idea/automate-memory-stores-cleanup-using`
  - Origin: Generated by idea executor for "Automate Memory Stores Cleanup Using".
  - Status: Branch contains only a single revert commit that removed `scripts/git-sync.sh` and modified `quick`. This commit does not implement the intended idea; the idea execution failed validation due to mismatched commit message. The branch is effectively orphaned.
  - Current HEAD points to this branch, which is undesirable for a production workspace.
- No other local branches exist; remote has no `idea/*` branches.
- Active tasks registry clean (<2KB), no running agents.

## Requirements

- Remove the stale branch (local and remote if present).
- Switch to `master` branch as the working branch.
- Maintain workspace hygiene and documentation.
- Record this cleanup in `memory/2026-02-22.md`.
- Validate system health post-cleanup.

## Observations

1. **Stale branch analysis:**
   - Commit graph:
     - `master` at commit `1fd14f29` which added `git-sync` utility (scripts/git-sync.sh) and integrated it into `quick`.
     - Feature branch `idea/automate-memory-stores-cleanup-using` at `d49c9e8d` which is a revert of that add.
   - The `git-sync` utility is actually **present on master** and useful: it provides a safe fetch/pull workflow checking for uncommitted changes and preventing accidental overwrites. This is a valuable tool; the revert on the feature branch was likely an attempt to undo an unintentionally committed feature, but the feature itself is beneficial.
   - The feature branch never delivered its intended "memory stores cleanup" feature; it only contains a revert. It should be deleted.

2. **HEAD position:**
   - Currently on the stale branch. Must checkout `master` before deletion to avoid errors.

3. **Remote status:**
   - No remote `idea/` branches found, likely because the branch was never pushed or already deleted remotely. Only local deletion needed.

4. **Daily log:**
   - The daily log file `memory/2026-02-22.md` already contains entries for earlier events (workspace-builder runs, notifier, maintenance). We should append a brief entry documenting this cleanup for continuity.

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Switch to `master` and delete the local stale branch | The branch is orphaned, contains no valuable work, and clutters repository. |
| Do NOT revert git-sync on master | The git-sync utility is useful for safe git operations; it is already integrated and working. Keep it. |
| Only local branch deletion needed | Remote already lacks the branch; no push needed for remote deletion. |
| Append daily log entry | Maintains record of maintenance actions for future reference. |
| No active-tasks.md update needed | This is a main cron session, not a spawned sub-agent; active-tasks tracks only sub-agents. |

## Success Criteria

- Current branch is `master`.
- Stale branch removed locally.
- No references to the stale branch remain in local branch list.
- Health check passes.
- Daily log appended with summary.
- Git status clean (only possibly updated daily log).
- active-tasks.md unchanged and <2KB.

## Resources

- AGENTS.md - active tasks and session handling guidelines
- CRON_JOBS.md - cron schedules (no changes needed)
- `quick health` - health verification
- `memory/2026-02-22.md` - daily log
