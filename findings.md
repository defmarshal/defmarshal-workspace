## Change Analysis

### 1. apps/dashboard/data.json
**Changes**:
- `generated_at`: 22:00:02Z → 23:00:01Z (refreshed)
- Agent status updates:
  - `linkedin-pa-agent`: last_run 21:11 → 22:03
  - `agent-manager`: last_run 20:00 → 22:00
  - `meta-agent`: active: true → false
- `recent_commits`: added 2 entries at top (content + build), removed 2 older entries at bottom

**Interpretation**: This file is auto-generated by a dashboard data collection process. The modifications reflect recent agent activity and commit history. The file should be committed to keep published data current. The meta-agent becoming inactive is expected (it ran at 19:08 and hasn't run again yet; the active flag likely reflects "running now" state, not "has run recently").

**Action**: Commit this file as part of routine updates.

---

### 2. apps/dashboard/vercel.json
**Changes**:
- Version: 1 → 2
- Build configuration changed from simple static build to separate static and static-build rules
- Routes unchanged

**Interpretation**: Dashboard deployment configuration updated, likely to support new features or optimize Vercel deployment (static assets vs full build). This is an intentional improvement.

**Action**: Commit this configuration change with appropriate build prefix.

---

### 3. content/INDEX.md
**Changes**:
- Added 55 lines of new content entries (top of Recent Content section)
- Removed 3 older entries from bottom (content rotation)

**Pattern**: The index is manually curated by content-agent or manually edited. The changes appear to reflect new LinkedIn PA content produced today. However, the manual edits may be out of sync with the actual `content-index-update` command output.

**Check**: Need to verify if these entries match exactly what `./quick content-index-update` would produce.

---

### 4. apps/dashboard/.gitignore (untracked)
**Status**: Not yet added; contents unknown.

**Hypothesis**: May contain build artifacts or local dev config (e.g., `.vercel/`, `node_modules/`, `.env`). Should be tracked if it's project-specific and safe to share.

**Action**: Read file to determine if it should be added to repo.

---

## Preliminary Action Plan

1. **Read .gitignore** to assess appropriateness
2. **Compare INDEX.md** with `./quick content-index-update` dry-run to see if manual edits are correct or if we should regenerate
3. **Decide** whether to commit as-is or regenerate INDEX.md
4. **Commit all changes** with build prefix
5. **Push** to origin
6. **Validate** constraints
7. **Update** active-tasks.md and push final docs
