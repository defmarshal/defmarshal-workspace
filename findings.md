# Findings — Workspace Builder 2026-02-28 17:05 UTC

## Issue
Git constraint failing due to 2 modified but uncommitted files:
1. `apps/dashboard/data.json` — auto-generated by dashboard data generator (system metrics, agent status, recent commits)
2. `memory/disk-history.json` — historical disk usage metrics

Both files are tracked and should be committed periodically. They were modified by background agents (supervisor, health checks) after the last commit but before this workspace-builder run.

## Root Cause
The workspace-builder runs every 2 hours, but system metrics update more frequently (every 30 min). This creates a window where files are dirty at the start of a workspace-builder run. Historically this is handled by committing these files during the run.

## Impact
- Constraint validation fails (git dirty)
- If not fixed, could cause cascading issues (other agents may refuse to run if constraints not met)

## Resolution Plan
1. Stage and commit the two files with appropriate message
2. Verify git clean
3. Update active-tasks.md with validation status
4. Ensure constraints pass
5. Push to origin

## Additional Observations
- MEMORY.md is at 31 lines (limit is 35, but preferred 30). Not critical; could trim to 30 if needed.
- Disk usage: 79% (healthy, under 90%)
- All agents running, supervisor healthy, memory reindex fresh (0 days)
- No stale idea branches
- All shebangs valid

## Risk Assessment
Low risk — only committing auto-generated state tracking files. No code changes.
