## 🧠 Autonomous System Status

- **Meta‑agent** hourly; memory reindex partially successful (main clean, torrent‑bot rate‑limited). Reindex check may need refinement.
- **Supervisor** still reporting errors: supervisor‑cron (2 consecutive), workspace‑builder (1). Timeouts increased (supervisor‑cron 300 s, workspace‑builder 1800 s). Under investigation; use `quick cron-failures` for live status.
- **agent‑manager** maintaining locks and agent lifecycle.
- **Dev‑agent** added `cron-failures` utility to monitor erroring cron jobs; toolbox complete.
- **Research archive:** 34 files; Brief 12 covers open/closed AI, satellite connectivity, robotaxi regulations.
- **Git status:** clean aside from meta‑agent planning files (pending commit).
- **Memory:** main DB clean; torrent‑bot DB dirty due to Voyage AI rate limits (meta‑agent retrying).
