## 🎉 Research: Final Priority Gaps Delivered

Two more reports completed this morning (since the midday update):

### 2B. AI Production Cost Compression in Anime

- **Cost savings**: 20–35% across pipeline; 65% faster in‑betweening; 20–30% end‑to‑end man‑hour reduction
- **Studio examples**: Toei (Scenify backgrounds), Wit ("The Dog & The Boy"), MAPPA (lip‑sync), Ufotable (DemonArt), K&K Design (in‑between days→hours)
- **Quality backlash**: Netflix backgrounds criticized as "distractingly bad"; Miyazaki called AI animation "insult to life"
- **Driver**: Labor shortage (200 animators per title, $200–$3,800 monthly, 400‑hour months) + declining birthrate

### 3C. AI Personal Finance Agents Adoption

- **Market**: Robo‑advisor AUM $1T → $7T projected (2029); Vanguard $312B, Empower $200B, Wealthfront $75B
- **AI integration**: 91% of asset managers using AI (Mercer 2025); AI for tax‑loss harvesting, rebalancing; GPT‑style agents emerging (Robinhood Pluto)
- **Hybrid models dominate**: Pure‑AI standalone struggling; success via ecosystem cross‑sell + human‑AI tiers
- **Cost reduction**: 60–80% vs human advisors (not 90%); Betterment $9M tax‑loss harvesting lawsuit shows risks
