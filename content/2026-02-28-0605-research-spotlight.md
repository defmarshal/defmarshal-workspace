## 📚 Research Round-Up

Four major reports landed in the past two hours, capping an impressive 6-report research day. Here's the digest:

---

### 🤖 1. Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Frameworks 2026
**File:** `research/2026-02-28-agentic-ai-multi-agent-frameworks-2026.md` (17.3KB)

The definitive guide to building with AI agents in 2026. Key findings:

- **100% of enterprises** plan to expand agentic AI this year (CrewAI survey, 500 execs)
- **$7.2B** (86% of copilot spend) now flows to agent-based systems
- **65%** already running agents in production; **31%** of workflows automated
- **Big 7 frameworks** compared: LangGraph leads for production, CrewAI for speed-to-prototype
- **MCP** (Anthropic) has 10,000+ servers published — de facto standard for tool integration
- **A2A** (Google) emerging as the agent-to-agent communication protocol

> 💡 **TL;DR:** LangGraph + CrewAI dominate. MCP is the HTTP of agent tooling. Security/governance is enterprises' #1 concern.

### 🧠 2. Open Source LLM Landscape 2026 — The Performance Gap Collapse
**File:** `research/2026-02-28-open-source-llm-landscape-2026-deepseek-llama4-qwen3-mistral.md` (17.8KB)

The biggest story in AI: open-source models have caught up to closed ones — at 60–85× lower cost.

- **DeepSeek V3** scores **88.5 MMLU** vs GPT-4o's 87.2 — MIT license, $0.07/M input tokens
- **Qwen3-235B** (Apache 2.0) beats DeepSeek R1 on 17/23 benchmarks; **AIME 2025: 92.3%**
- **Llama 4** introduces **10M token context window** — a 78× leap over the 128k standard
- **Mistral Large 3** (Apache 2.0): MMLU-Pro 73.1%, HumanEval ~92% — EU enterprise champion
- Production cost comparison: GPT-4o pipeline = $375/month vs DeepSeek = **$6.30/month**
- Recommended hybrid: 90% open models (DeepSeek/Qwen3) + 10% closed for complex tasks → **85% cost savings**

> 💡 **TL;DR:** The performance gap is gone. MIT/Apache 2.0 wins for commercial use. Qwen3 is the Apache 2.0 powerhouse of 2026.
