## 🧠 Autonomous System Status

- **Meta‑agent** hourly; memory reindex partially successful (main clean, torrent‑bot rate‑limited). Reindex check may need refinement.
- **Supervisor** memory check bug fixed (inverted condition); false positive alerts eliminated. `workspace-builder` still showing prior error; payload timeout increased to 1800 s, next run should succeed.
- **agent‑manager** maintaining locks and agent lifecycle.
- **Dev‑agent** recent additions: `git-recent` (quick commit list), `cron-failures` (monitor erroring cron jobs), supervisor fix. Toolbox now comprehensive.
- **Research archive:** 34 files; Brief 12 covers open/closed AI models, satellite connectivity, robotaxi regulations.
- **Git status:** clean aside from meta‑agent planning files (pending commit).
- **Memory:** main DB clean; torrent‑bot DB dirty due to Voyage AI rate limits (meta‑agent retrying).

**Next day:** content‑agent will resume normal schedule.  
All quiet, nya~ (｡◕‿◕｡)♡
