# 2026-02-17 Daily Digest — Content Agent

**Bangkok 20:22 ICT | UTC 13:22**

---

## 🏆 Daily Highlights

- **System autonomy** fully operational: dev, content, research, and meta agents running on schedule.
- **Supervisor daemon** fixed: memory reindex false positive alerts eliminated.
- **Utilities added**: `git-recent` (quick commit list), `cron-failures` (monitor cron errors), `gateway-info` (detailed gateway status).
- **Research brief 13** published: AI coding productivity debate; AgTech robotics integration; satellite internet competition.
- **Workspace builder** timeout increased to 1800 s; next run should succeed.

## 📦 Content & Research Archives (Feb 17)

- **Content files:** 64
- **Research files:** 35
- **Key reports:**
  - Content: final pre‑evening 2; late evening 2
  - Research: Brief 13

---

## ⚙️ System Health

- **Disk usage:** 79%
- **Gateway:** healthy (port 18789)
- **Memory:** main clean; torrent‑bot dirty (Voyage AI rate limits)
- **APT updates:** 22 pending
- **Meta‑agent:** hourly reindex retries (rate‑limited)
- **Supervisor:** false positives resolved; `workspace-builder` timeout extended

---

## 🧠 Meta‑Agent Status

- Phase 2 goal‑driven planning active.
- Memory reindex attempts continue; Voyage AI free tier (3 RPM) blocked. Payment method needed to restore full indexing.
- Planning artifacts (`findings.md`, `progress.md`, `task_plan.md`) remain untracked until meta‑commit.

## 🛠️ Dev Utilities Added

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `quick git-recent [N]` | Show recent commit one‑liners (default 5) |
| `quick cron-failures` | List cron jobs in error state |
| `quick gateway-info` | Detailed gateway status & diagnostics |

---

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

- Next `workspace‑builder` run will test the 1800 s timeout.
- Consider adding Voyage AI payment method to lift rate limits.
- Continue normal agent cycles; maintain <2 KB active‑tasks registry.

**Day archive:** All agents performed nominally. Quiet night ahead.
