## 🤖 The AI Deluge (Two Reports)

**Frontier AI Models — February 2026 Surge** covered all seven major model releases from six labs in a single month. The headline is Gemini 3.1 Pro's 77.1% ARC-AGI-2 score — more than double its predecessor's 31.1%, and one of the largest single-generation reasoning jumps ever documented on that benchmark. Claude Sonnet 4.6 surprised by beating Opus on real expert-work preference ratings. GPT-5.3 Codex leads terminal automation efficiency. Grok 4.20 introduced a genuinely novel 4-agent parallel debate architecture. And GLM-5 from China's Z.ai demonstrated that frontier-class training is achievable on Huawei chips, MIT-licensed.

## 💳 Finance in Southeast Asia (One Report)

**SEA Digital Banking & Fintech 2026** took an honest look at the profitability reckoning underway in the region. Globally, less than 25% of digital banks break even. Malaysia is seeing serial CEO departures. The structural failure modes are real — distribution, proposition, talent. But there's a success model (Bank Jago riding GoTo's distribution), and agentic payments are arriving in production form (Mastercard Agent Pay, HSBC 2-4× fraud detection improvement). The ASEAN QR cross-border network is more interconnected than most people realise: PromptPay, PayNow, DuitNow, QRIS, WeChat Pay, GrabPay and ShopeePay all now link up.

## ⚡ Energy's Economic Inflection (One Report)

**Green Tech & Climate AI 2026** landed on a single thesis: clean energy stopped being primarily a policy story and became an economics story. Battery storage at $70/kWh. Solar cheapest new electricity in most markets. $2 trillion in annual clean energy investment for the first time. The tension: AI data centers are driving electricity demand up 39 of 50 US states, while AI tools (GraphCast weather models, grid optimisation ML) are among the best climate tools available. Nuclear SMR investment is real; SMR power generation is 2029–2035.

## 🚀 Space Gets Serious (One Report)

**Commercial Space 2026** covered the year's most concrete milestones. Artemis II — the first crewed Moon mission since 1972 — is scheduled NLT April 1. Starship's critical propellant transfer demonstration is targeted for June. Haven-1 (Vast Space) would be the first standalone private space station if it launches on schedule. Chang'e 7 heads for the lunar south pole. $613B space economy growing toward $1T by 2032.

## 🧬 Biotech & The GLP-1 Wave (One Report)

**Biotech & Longevity 2026** examined how GLP-1 agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide) are reshaping medicine beyond weight loss — MASH treatment, cardiovascular mortality reduction, potential Alzheimer's signals — while AI drug discovery compresses timelines and gene therapy moves from rare disease treatment toward mainstream medicine.

## 🔒 Cybersecurity's AI Arms Race (One Report)

**Cybersecurity 2026** documented the year's defining dynamic: defenders and attackers both deploying AI, with the advantage shifting based on who moves faster. $820M ransomware economy. Post-quantum cryptography migration now urgent. Agentic AI systems creating new attack surfaces. Zero-trust identity architecture as the baseline response.

## 💰 Fintech's Execution Era (One Report)

**Fintech & Digital Banking 2026 (global)** covered the broader landscape: Revolut at $75B and profitable, Monzo at 8× growth, neobank profitability rates rising, stablecoin infrastructure becoming real financial plumbing, and the CBDC rollout timeline becoming clearer.

## 🖥️ The AI Chip Wars (One Report)

**AI Hardware & Chips 2026** made the case for focusing on four things: Blackwell GPU economics (the ROI math that justifies $435B in hyperscaler capex), Vera Rubin's 10× inference cost drop coming in H2 2026, AMD's real position (wins on cost inference, loses on frontier training), and CoWoS packaging as the actual supply constraint.

## 🌸 Spring Anime (One Report)

**Spring 2026 Anime Season Preview** covered the most stacked lineup in years: Classroom of the Elite S4 (90-min special Apr 1), Witch Hat Atelier (Crunchyroll Anime Nights feature, Apr 6), Daemons of the Shadow Realm (Bones Film, Hiromu Arakawa), Re:Zero S4 (Arc 6), One Piece Elbaph, Kaiju No. 8 S2, Blue Lock S3, and Ghost in the Shell (Science SARU, confirmed July). Spring and Summer 2026 together form one of the richest anime programming windows in recent memory.
