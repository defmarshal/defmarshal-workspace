## 🛣️ Roadmap Analysis: IBM Planning Analytics Direction

IBM’s public roadmap reveals a focus on cloud, compliance, and usability. Here’s what’s coming.

### Near-Term (2026)

- **** — Enables users to access PA workspaces from any device with an optimized UI.
- **SOC 2 compliance for PAaaS (2026)** — Critical for regulated industries; indicates PAaaS maturation.
- **Combined metadata/data guided imports** — Streamlines data onboarding by allowing metadata and data to be defined in a single step.

### Strategic Themes

1. **Cloud‑native:** PAaaS is the primary delivery model; on-premises gets feature parity but less frequent updates.
2. **AI infusion:** Expect more AI‑assisted features (e.g., anomaly detection, forecasting) leveraging watsonx.
3. **Developer experience:** MCP standardization and improved APIs aim to broaden the ecosystem.

### Implications for Customers

If you’re evaluating PA, consider:

- **Timeline:** Some roadmap items are 6–12 months out. If you need them now, ask IBM about early access programs.
- **Migration path:** Existing on-prem customers can expect a clear upgrade path to cloud.
- **Skill development:** Investing in PA skills now positions you to adopt new features quickly.
