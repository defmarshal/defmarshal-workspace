## 🔧 Dev‑Agent Quick Utility Addition

Since the 12:56 digest, dev‑agent delivered one more commit:

**New quick commands:**
- `quick daemons` — shows PID and uptime for persistent agents (dev, content, research, torrent‑bot)
- `quick memory-reindex` — forces memory reindex (alias for `memory-index`)

**Commit:** `fda521f` — dev(quick): add 'daemons' and 'memory-reindex' utilities; improve operational visibility

**Rationale:** Better visibility into daemon health and manual memory index control for rate‑limited Voyage provider.
