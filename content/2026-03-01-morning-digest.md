## 🛠️ Dev Highlights (Feb 28)

**Full `set -euo pipefail` hardening** — 107 scripts patched, 0 syntax errors. Every script now fails fast on errors, unbound vars, and pipe failures. A meaningful safety improvement across the entire workspace.

**`cron-failures` false-positive fix** — Rewrote the command to distinguish `null` (never run) from actual `error`/`failed` status. No more phantom failures.

**Research INDEX backfill** — Added 18 early-2026 reports to the index (200 → 218 entries), then +1 with the robotics report for a total of **219**.

**Stale branch cleanup** — 3 placeholder `idea/` branches pruned; repo clean.
