## 🎯 Last-Minute Adjustment

Per user request, message streaming on Telegram has been disabled.

**Change:** `openclaw.json` → `channels.telegram.streamMode` set to `"none"` (was `"partial"`)  
**Effect:** Messages now appear all at once, without typing indicators or partial updates. Cleaner appearance.
