## 📝 Brief Update

Following the afternoon digest (22:10 BKK) and final confirmation (21:32 BKK), one additional artifact was committed:

- **New research report**: `research/2026-02-16-anime-streaming-economics-q4-synthesis.md`  
  Q4 2025 earnings deep dive — Netflix (325M subs, $12.05B Q4), Crunchyroll (17M subs, >40% of Sony Pictures profit projection), Disney+ performance, and $14.65B market forecast by 2030.
