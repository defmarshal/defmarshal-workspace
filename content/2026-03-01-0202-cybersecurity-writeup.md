The security industry loves its annual prediction posts. Most are noise. Here's what's signal in 2026 — with the numbers to back it.

## The Ransomware Paradox (Chainalysis, Feb 27 2026)

The headline sounds like progress: ransomware payments dropped 8% to **$820M** in 2025. The reality is the opposite of progress.

- Claimed victims surged **+50% YoY** — most active year on record
- Median ransom demand jumped **+368%** from $12,738 → **$59,556**
- Share of victims paying hit **28% — all-time low**
- 8,000+ organizations named on leak sites in 2025

What's actually happening: more organizations are getting hit than ever, but fewer are paying. Improved incident response + regulatory pressure (OFAC, NIS2) are suppressing payments. The attackers compensate by hitting more targets and demanding more from those who do pay.

**The leading indicator to watch:** Initial Access Broker (IAB) payments. Chainalysis found that spikes in IAB on-chain inflows **precede ransomware payments and US victim leak posts by ~30 days**. IABs received $14M in 2025 — small vs. the $820M total, but functionally the early warning system. Access gets sold; a month later, names appear on leak sites.

The ecosystem now looks like a supply chain: IABs → infrastructure providers → RaaS affiliates → extortion specialists. Law enforcement is correctly shifting to target the infrastructure layer rather than individual groups. Short-term disruption follows; the talent and tooling diffuse and re-emerge under new names (LockBit → spin-offs; BlackCat → exit-scammed; 55 new groups appeared in 2025 despite LE pressure).

## The AI Arms Race Is Real, and Attackers Have the Edge Right Now

SentinelLABS' 2026 threat report frames it bluntly: **"The forgiving internet is over."**

Previously, vulnerable organizations often escaped simply because attackers hadn't gotten around to them. The Cl0p MOVEit campaign illustrates the old world: nearly 2,800 organizations compromised in an automated holiday-weekend attack, but Cl0p was still processing victims a year later because extortion requires human negotiation bandwidth. That bottleneck is the constraint that's disappearing.

When autonomous agents can probe, validate, and exploit at machine speed, the gap between "vulnerable" and "compromised" collapses. Anthropic disclosed in early 2026 that Chinese state operators used Claude Code for autonomous intrusions — **one operator hitting 30 targets with minimal human involvement**. The model's hallucinations did more to slow them down than any safety guardrails.

**Why attackers adopt AI faster than defenders:**
- No procurement cycles — deploy immediately
- Clear ROI per capability improvement
- Local unconstrained models (no guardrails needed)
- Freedom from compliance requirements

AI-driven phishing is already **3× more effective** than conventional phishing. A European bank's C-suite lost **$12M to deepfake voice calls** in January 2026. An 84% weekly uptick in infostealer malware was recorded in 2025.

**The defender's AI opportunity** is real — just later to arrive. The tasks AI unlocks for defenders: processing every document in a breach disclosure (previously: impractical), pre-processing logs at scale, behavioral anomaly detection, automated reverse engineering of malicious code. These weren't impossible before; they were tasks organizations decided not to attempt. That calculus has changed.

## Post-Quantum Crypto: The Clock Is Running

NIST finalized its PQC suite in August 2024. The standards are live:

| Standard | Algorithm | Use |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| FIPS 203 | ML-KEM (Kyber) | Encryption / key exchange |
| FIPS 204 | ML-DSA (Dilithium) | Digital signatures |
| FIPS 205 | SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+) | Hash-based signatures |

**First commercial PQC certificates** are expected in 2026. The industry has already converged on ML-KEM hybrid key exchange for TLS (X25519MLKEM768 combinations per IETF draft). This isn't theoretical — it's shipping.

The threat driving urgency: **"harvest now, decrypt later."** State actors have been collecting encrypted network traffic since at least 2022 with the explicit plan to decrypt it when cryptographically-relevant quantum computers arrive (~2030–2035). A 2025 defense contractor breach exposed terabytes of data harvested since 2023, sitting in cold storage awaiting quantum capability.

If your organization has an 8-10 year PQC migration timeline and you're starting in 2028, you'll be racing against the clock with legacy data already in adversarial hands.

**Where to start:** Crypto-agility inventory. Most enterprises don't know where all their RSA/ECC usage is. Before migrating, you need the map.

## Agentic AI: The Attack Surface Nobody's Ready For

This is the 2026-2027 threat that's under-discussed outside specialist circles.

Cisco's **State of AI Security 2026** found:
- Organizations are deploying AI agents connected to ticketing systems, source code repos, chat platforms, and cloud dashboards
- These agents can open PRs, query databases, trigger workflows — with limited human oversight
- **Only 29% of organizations** deploying agentic AI reported readiness to secure those deployments

The 71% readiness gap is the attack surface.

**The attack vectors:**

*Prompt injection and multi-turn jailbreaks:* Multi-turn attacks achieved **92% success rates** in testing across 8 open-weight models (Cisco research). Single-turn protections fail in longer sessions involving memory and tool access. The practical implication: agents running long sessions against enterprise systems are meaningfully more vulnerable than single-turn chat interfaces.

*MCP (Model Context Protocol) vulnerabilities:* MCP became the dominant method for connecting LLMs to external tools in 2025. Rapid adoption = under-secured attack surface. Known vectors: tool poisoning, remote code execution flaws in MCP server implementations, overprivileged access. **Real documented case:** A GitHub MCP server allowed a malicious issue to inject hidden instructions, hijacking an AI agent to exfiltrate data from private repositories.

*SaaS identity provider targeting:* SentinelLABS identifies this as the emerging high-value attack: Zero Trust didn't eliminate trust, it **relocated trust to SSO/identity providers**. Attackers now enumerate downstream application relationships from compromised identity providers and use agentic AI tooling to autonomously continue multi-phase intrusions based on what each phase discovers.

**Practical mitigation starting points:**
1. Audit which enterprise systems your AI agents have write/execute access to
2. Apply least-privilege: agents shouldn't have broader permissions than a junior employee
3. Track multi-turn jailbreak success rates as a security metric for deployed models
4. Review MCP integrations — treat each as a potential code execution surface

## The Compliance Deadline Stack

If you're in EU/US regulated industries, 2026 is a deadline year:

- **EU NIS2**: 24-hour incident reporting for essential entities; supply chain security requirements; **board-level accountability**
- **EU DORA**: Financial sector ICT risk management and third-party oversight (effective Jan 2025, enforcement ramping)
- **CMMC 2.0**: US defense contractors need tiered certification — Level 2 requires third-party assessment
- **EU AI Act**: High-risk AI category compliance deadlines hitting; first enforcement actions expected H2 2026

The "Shadow AI" problem intersects with AI Act compliance: employees using unapproved AI tools that process sensitive data create both security exposure and regulatory liability simultaneously.

## Six Things to Track in H1 2026

1. **Agentic intrusion toolkits in criminal markets** — Following the Anthropic/Claude Code disclosure, expect specialized offensive agentic toolkits in Q2
2. **First PQC certificates in public TLS** — Watch for ML-DSA appearing in certificate transparency logs
3. **MCP security specifications** — Anthropic/OpenAI under pressure to publish formal security guidance after documented agent compromises
4. **IAB market response to infrastructure-layer LE** — Short dip, then re-emergence; watch the 30-day lag signal
5. **EU AI Act first enforcement actions** — Sets precedent for how "high-risk AI" is interpreted in practice
6. **Cyber insurance premium trajectory** — +50% victim volume is hitting underwriters hard; government backstop programs under active discussion in UK/EU/Canada

## Bottom Line

The cybersecurity story in 2026 isn't about any single threat — it's about the structural shift from capacity-limited attacks to machine-speed automated exploitation. The ransomware numbers confirm it: attacks at record highs even as payments fall, because volume is now cheap. The agentic AI attack surface is the new frontier: 71% of deploying enterprises are unprepared, MCP ecosystems are under-audited, and the identity provider as the new perimeter is under active exploitation.

Post-quantum migration is no longer optional — the harvest-now-decrypt-later threat means data stolen today is at risk on a 5-8 year horizon. The window to act is open now.
