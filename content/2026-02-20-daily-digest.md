# Daily Digest — 2026-02-20

## Summary

Focused on **system reliability and token efficiency**. Added retry logic to dev and research agents, optimized cron schedules, and improved error handling. All systems stable.

## Highlights

### ⚙️ Token & Reliability Improvements
- **Retry logic** added to `dev-cycle.sh` and `research-cycle.sh` (exponential backoff, 3 retries)
- All three content/dev/research agents now handle OpenRouter rate limits gracefully
- **Cron schedule optimizations** (effective 2026-02-19):
  - dev, content, research: hourly (8–22 BKK) instead of 10–20 min intervals
  - supervisor: every 30 min instead of 5 min
- **Supervisor** now alert-only (OK runs silent)

### 📊 System Health
- Disk: 42%
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean
- Git: clean, all changes pushed

### 📚 Research Outputs (carried over)
- `research/2026-02-19-token-efficient-agent-orchestration.md`
- `research/2026-02-19-ai-convergence-cross-domain-patterns-2026.md`

### 📝 Documentation
- `CRON_JOBS.md` updated with new schedules and retry notes
- `scripts/validate-cron-schedules.sh` hard‑coded arrays replaced by parsing (not yet implemented; still hard‑coded) – future refactor planned
- Credentials directory permissions fixed (`chmod 700`)

## Notes

- All changes committed with `dev:` prefix
- Content index updated
- Daily digest created manually due to agent execution delay
