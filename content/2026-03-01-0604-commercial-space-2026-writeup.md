# To the Moon and Beyond: What's Actually Happening in Space Right Now

*March 1, 2026*

---

Something quietly historic is unfolding in 2026, and it's easy to miss amid the AI headlines and geopolitical noise. Three separate "first-ever" events in space are converging in the same calendar year — not because anyone planned it that way, but because years of accumulated delays pushed them all into the same window.

Here's what's actually happening, and why it matters.

## Humans are going back to the Moon next month

Not landing — not yet. But for the first time since Apollo 17 in December 1972, a human crew will leave Earth orbit and travel to the vicinity of the Moon.

**Artemis II** launches no earlier than April 1, 2026. Four astronauts aboard NASA's Orion spacecraft will spend ten days on a free-return trajectory around the Moon — swinging past the lunar surface and using its gravity to redirect back to Earth. Commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover (first African American beyond low Earth orbit), mission specialist Christina Koch (first woman on a lunar trajectory), and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen will cover ~400,000 km of deep space.

This is not a landing mission. It's a shakedown cruise — every Orion system gets validated with humans aboard before NASA commits to the actual Moon landing. The mission was delayed from February when engineers identified a helium flow issue in the SLS upper stage. As of late February, that issue is resolved and the countdown is genuine.

The Moon landing itself (Artemis III) has slipped to no earlier than 2027, held back by a SpaceX problem that almost nobody outside the space community is talking about.

## SpaceX has to solve something nobody has ever done before

To deliver the Starship Human Landing System to lunar orbit, SpaceX first has to demonstrate **in-orbit propellant transfer** — refueling one Starship variant from another in space, with cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen, at the scale required for a lunar mission.

This has never been done. Not by anyone, anywhere, at this scale.

Starship is too heavy and too large to reach the Moon in a single launch. The HLS vehicle needs to stop at an orbital depot — essentially a Starship-shaped gas station — and top up its tanks before heading toward the Moon. SpaceX is targeting June 2026 for this demonstration.

If it works: uncrewed Starship lunar landing in June 2027, crewed Artemis III in September 2028.
If it doesn't: the entire US lunar timeline collapses further.

SpaceX has now completed 11 integrated Starship test flights and successfully caught the booster with the "Mechazilla" chopstick arms. The rocket works. The refueling is the remaining unsolved problem, and June 2026 is when we find out.

## The first private space station may launch in May

**Vast Space** — a California startup funded by Jared Isaacman — is targeting a **Falcon 9 launch in May/June 2026** carrying **Haven-1**, a single-module station roughly the size of a shipping container.

At 31,000 lbs, it will be the heaviest single payload a Falcon 9 has ever carried. It will host crews of four for up to ten days. The interior is designed to feel less like the utilitarian ISS and more like somewhere humans might actually want to be — earth tones, inflatable sleep pods, an improved menu.

If it launches on schedule, Vast becomes the operator of the first standalone commercial space station in history.

That's a landmark, but the actual goal is Haven-2 — a 9-module station Vast wants to build once they secure NASA's Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations Phase 2 funding ($1–1.5 billion, expected to be awarded in 2026). The ISS is being decommissioned in 2030, and someone needs to replace it. The race is between Vast, Axiom Space (which is building modules to attach to the ISS first), and Starlab (a Voyager Space/Airbus joint venture aiming for a 2028 launch aboard Starship).

## China is also heading to the lunar south pole this year

While the US and its partners work through Artemis, China's Chang'e 7 mission is targeting a **2026 launch** to the Moon's south pole — specifically to survey the permanently shadowed craters where water ice has been detected.

The mission carries a "mini flying probe" capable of descending into those craters — places sunlight has never reached — to directly detect water. This matters because water ice at the lunar south pole isn't just scientifically interesting: it's potentially rocket propellant. Water can be split into liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Whoever figures out how to extract and use it has a massive strategic advantage in the emerging cislunar economy.

Both NASA's Artemis program and China's International Lunar Research Station initiative are targeting **the same south pole region**. There is no international framework adequate for adjudicating what happens when both parties want to put hardware in the same place.

## The numbers behind all of this

The global space economy hit **$613 billion in 2024** — up 8% from the year before. Space Foundation projects it crossing $1 trillion by 2032. The World Economic Forum says $1.8 trillion by 2035.

The dominant drivers are satellite broadband (Starlink and its competitors), Earth observation intelligence (now used for everything from crop monitoring to tracking military movements), and launch services (dramatically cheaper since SpaceX made rocket reusability routine).

What's new in 2026 is the emergence of real economic activity *in orbit* — not just using orbit as a relay point, but as a place where things are built, manufactured, and inhabited for commercial reasons. The private space station race is the first concrete expression of this shift.

## What to watch

**April 2026:** Artemis II launch. First humans beyond Earth orbit since 1972.

**May/June 2026:** Haven-1 launch attempt. First standalone commercial space station, if it makes it.

**June 2026:** SpaceX orbital propellant transfer demonstration. The single most consequential technical test of the year for the Moon program.

**Later 2026:** NASA CLD Phase 2 awards. $1–1.5 billion that determines who builds the ISS successor.

Three "first-evers" in three months. None of them guaranteed. All of them pointing in the same direction.

Space is becoming less of a government program and more of an industry. 2026 is when that transition goes from aspirational to operational.
