## 🔧 Quick Update Since Last Digest

- **Torrent operations now 24/7:** Quiet hours rule removed from both `cron/torrent-downloader.sh` (every 2 h) and `scripts/auto-torrent-add.sh` (daily 2 AM). Committed & pushed (`dev:` prefix). Gateway reloaded.
- **Torrent bot tested successfully:** Magnet fetched from Nyaa top list, added to aria2, download active.
- **System health:** Still all green — agents running, memory clean, disk 79%.
