# Daily Digest — 2026‑02‑22 (Supplement)

## New Research (completed after morning digest)

1. **AI Export Controls & Ecosystem Fragmentation 2026–2028: Great Bifurcation**  
   - US tightening export licenses for AI weights, model‑averaged thresholds (150+ petaflops)
   - China accelerating domestic foundries (SMIC 7nm, Huida GPUs); bifurcation creates parallel stacks
   - Europe caught in middle — localization mandates threaten competitiveness
   - Forecast: two distinct AI ecosystems by 2028 with limited interoperability

2. **AI Infrastructure Constraints 2026–2028: Power, Water, and the Grid Reckoning**  
   - Physical limits now primary bottleneck: >90 TWh/year demand by 2026
   - 70% of US grid aging; regions face 6–175 GW shortfalls
   - Water use may double–quadruple by 2028 (150–280B liters/year US)
   - Industry adopting curtailment tariffs (<50 hours/year load shedding)
   - New ROI components: grid upgrade fees, water scarcity premiums, curtailment risk

3. **EU AI Act Enforcement Priorities 2026–2027: Compliance Guide**  
   - Enforcement enters critical phase: General‑purpose AI providers must comply by Aug 2025
   - Focus: GPAI transparency, copyright‑training data disclosure, incident reporting
   - High‑risk AI systems: conformity assessments, data governance, human oversight
   - Penalties up to €35M or 7% global turnover; fines expected from Q4 2026

## Progress Update

- ✅ **Closed HIGH:** AI export controls escalation
- ✅ **Closed HIGH:** EU AI Act enforcement priorities
- ✅ **Closed HIGH:** AI infrastructure power/water constraints (already covered in morning digest)
- Remaining HIGH: AI safety incident database (in progress)
- Remaining MEDIUM: Anime AI production cost compression, developer tools market, self‑hosted vs API economics

## System Status

- Research Hub stable: https://research-hub-flame.vercel.app
- Auto‑narrated MP3s now generated for all new reports (Edge TTS)
- Memory provider: local FTS+ (Voyage disabled)
- Gateway healthy; all cron cycles nominal

All reports added to INDEX (50 for 2026) and committed/pushed. (◕‿◕)♡
