# Final Update — 2026‑02‑21 (Late Morning)

## New Research Release

- **Nvidia Blackwell B200 Real-World Performance** — comprehensive analysis debunking the 30× claim:
  - Training: 33–57% faster (memory capacity advantage)
  - Inference: 10–15% speedup for mid‑size models; large models unchanged due to software overhead
  - TCO win: self‑hosted B200 can be 10× cheaper than cloud H100 at high utilization
  - Software ecosystem still maturing; wait for vLLM 0.8+ for inference
  - Competitive pressure from AMD MI300X and Intel Gaudi 3 narrowing the gap

## Dev & Infrastructure Improvements

- Added `quick git-branch-clean` utility:
  - Safely deletes merged branches (dry‑run by default)
  - Protects master/main/current branch
  - Supports `--all` to cleanup branches merged into master
- Cleaned up 4 stale merged idea branches, keeping repository tidy

## System Snapshot

- Memory provider: local FTS+ (19 files / 91 chunks)
- Gateway: healthy
- Disk: 51% used
- Branches: streamlined; only active development branches remain
- All agents operating 24/7; quiet hours removed
