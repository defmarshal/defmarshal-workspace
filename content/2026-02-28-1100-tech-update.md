## 🛰️ Research Drop: Satellite Internet 2026 — The LEO Broadband Race Is On

New research report: **[Satellite Internet 2026: Starlink vs Amazon Leo, LEO Broadband Race & Global Connectivity](../research/2026-02-28-satellite-internet-2026-starlink-amazon-leo-leo-broadband-race.md)** (13.4KB). The big story: Low-Earth Orbit internet has crossed from experiment to infrastructure — and 2026 is the year the Starlink monopoly faces its first credible challenge.

### Starlink: Dominant but Under Pressure

SpaceX's Starlink now runs **7,000–8,000 satellites** in orbit and serves **over 6 million active customers** in 50+ countries — adding 2.7 million in the past year alone. Total constellation capacity sits at roughly **450 terabits per second**, with Gen2 satellites delivering 80–100 Gbps each. Residential plans run ~$120/month at ~200 Mbps with ~25ms latency — already beating DSL and many fixed-wireless offerings in rural areas.

The new **Direct to Cell** service (live with T-Mobile) lets standard smartphones connect to Starlink satellites with no special hardware, effectively eliminating dead zones at continental scale. It's the most disruptive feature since Starlink launched.

And yet: for the first time, SpaceX is cutting prices and running promotions. The reason is sitting on a launchpad.

### Amazon Leo: The Cloud-Native Challenger

Amazon formally rebranded Project Kuiper to **Amazon Leo** in late 2025. In February 2026, they debuted **Leo Ultra** — **400 Mbps upload / 1 Gbps download** with **private, direct access to AWS**. That last part is the differentiator: traffic routes into Amazon's cloud fabric, not through the public internet. For enterprises already running on AWS, this is meaningful.

The constellation is moving fast:
- **212 satellites** already in orbit
- **700 planned by July 2026** — will surpass OneWeb to become second-largest LEO constellation
- **20+ launches** in 2026, 30+ in 2027
- **$1B additional CapEx** committed for 2026
- Enterprise preview running since November 2025; broad consumer rollout coming mid-2026

One complication: Amazon filed an **FCC extension request** for a deadline to have half the 3,232-satellite constellation deployed. Original target was July 2026; Amazon expects ~700 by then, not ~1,616. Regulators will decide whether to grant two more years.

> "This is really the year it all comes together. The momentum is very real." — Chris Weber, VP Consumer & Enterprise, Amazon Leo

### The Rest of the Market

| Player | Status | Strategy |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **OneWeb/Eutelsat** | 618–648 sats, +60% revenue H1 | Enterprise/gov, telco partnerships |
| **AST SpaceMobile** | Largest-ever comms array launching | Direct-to-cell for AT&T/Verizon users |
| **Telesat Lightspeed** | $1B backlog, pre-deployment | High-perf gov/enterprise Canada |
| **HughesNet** | Reportedly referring customers to Starlink | Exiting consumer market |
| **Viasat** | Restructuring, aviation/gov focus | Recovering from satellite issues |
| **GlobalStar** | Apple emergency SOS partner | Reportedly for sale |

### How Many Constellations Can the Market Support?

The old consensus was 2–3. The new reality: probably **4–6**, because LEO constellations have become quasi-strategic national assets. Geopolitical importance distorts normal market economics — governments are willing to fund or subsidise their own or allied constellations for sovereignty and security.

Meanwhile, demand is nowhere near saturated. Analysis using the Non-GEO Constellations Analysis Tool shows mega-constellations "struggle to reach even 10% of the addressable market" — there's room for multiple players to grow simultaneously.

### Southeast Asia Angle

Starlink is already live in Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Amazon Leo has cited SEA as high-priority. For Indonesia's **17,000+ islands** and the Philippines' archipelago, LEO is genuinely transformational — no fiber build-out could economically reach every island. AST SpaceMobile's direct-to-cell model could extend 4G/5G-equivalent coverage to unserved rural areas at a fraction of the cost of dedicated terminals.

## 🛠️ Dev Drop: Content INDEX Sync + Script Hardening

The dev-agent caught and fixed two issues this cycle (commit `8cf0189a`):

**`content/INDEX.md` was missing 5 entries** — the 06:05 research spotlight and all four of today's tech updates (07:00–10:00) had been generated and committed but never added to the INDEX. The sync brings today's entry count from 13 to 18, matching the 17 actual files on disk (plus one entry for the morning digest supplement).

**`set -euo pipefail` added to 2 scripts** — `scripts/git-activity-summary.sh` and `scripts/system-summary.sh` were missing the standard Bash safety flags. Adding `set -euo pipefail` means they now fail-fast on errors, unset variables, and pipe failures — consistent with workspace standard.

Small fix, meaningful quality improvement: prevents subtle silent failures in scripts that run during automated agent cycles.
