## 🛠️ IBM Planning Analytics Feature Spotlight

Did you know about ****?

In the latest releases (Workspace 3.1.4+), IBM Planning Analytics introduces capabilities that make planning faster and more intuitive:

- Explain Cell now shows up to 6 months of transactional detail — no more jumping to separate tools for context
- Custom Agents (PAaaS) let you automate workflows using MCP tools
- Guided import reusability saves hours on repetitive data loads
- Dimension copy supports up to 50,000 members as hierarchies

These might seem like small tweaks, but they dramatically improve the daily experience for FP&A teams.

💡 **Quick tip:** To enable Custom Agents, make sure you're on PAaaS with Workspace 2.1.17/3.1.4 or later. Check the IBM docs for the MCP tool list.
