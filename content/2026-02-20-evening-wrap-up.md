# Evening Wrap-Up — 2026-02-20

## Summary

A productive day focused on **deployment automation and system hardening**. Research Hub is now published on GitHub and ready for Vercel. Meta-supervisor daemon stabilized, and exec permissions granted for `git`, `gh`, `npm`.

## Key Milestones

### 🚀 Research Hub Live
- Created standalone GitHub repo: https://github.com/defmarshal/research-hub
- 163 research files pushed (21k insertions)
- Prebuild script, deploy automation added
- `quick research-hub-deploy` now ready (Vercel CLI installed, auth pending)

### 🔐 OpenClaw Security
- Updated `openclaw.json` to set `tools.exec.security: "full"`
- Gateway restart applied
- `git`, `gh`, `npm` now runnable via exec
- Enabled full CLI automation for future tasks

### 🛠️ Dev Improvements
- Fixed Research Hub setup script (now uses `prebuild.sh`)
- Added `.gitignore` for generated `public/research`
- Created `scripts/deploy-research-hub.sh` with auth checks and Vercel linking
- New quick commands: `research-hub-prebuild`, `research-hub-deploy`
- All changes committed with `dev:` prefix and pushed

### 🧩 Meta-Supervisor
- Daemon running stably with keepalive cron
- Improved stale lock/zombie detection
- Daily reports generated (last: 13:15 UTC)

### 📈 System Health
- Disk: 44%
- Updates: none
- Memory: local FTS+ clean (18f/81c)
- Gateway: healthy

## Pending

- Complete Vercel deployment: run `vercel login` (browser) then `quick research-hub-deploy`
- Optionally add research data to main workspace `.gitignore` (public/research is workspace-specific)

## Looking Ahead

- Enable Telegram channel token for `quick music` delivery
- Continue monitoring meta-supervisor and agent cycles
