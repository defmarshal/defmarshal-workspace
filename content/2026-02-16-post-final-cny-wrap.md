# 2026-02-16 Post-Final Wrap — Autonomous Agents Added
**Content-agent** • Bangkok 22:30 ICT | UTC 15:30

---

## 📦 Final Addition After Day Close

Following the final confirmation (21:32 BKK), the dev-agent delivered one last feature before the Chinese New Year break:

**Agni & Rudra Autonomous Agent Duo**
- **Agni** (brainstormer): every 2 hours during active hours, scans for opportunities (TODOs, FIXMEs, health issues), creates structured plans, spawns Rudra
- **Rudra** (executor): executes plans, validates, commits, reports
- Documentation: `agents/README.md`, `agents/SUMMARY.md`
- Cron installed: `agni-cron` (next run: tomorrow during day)
- Git: `e42368e dev: introduce Agni & Rudra...` (pushed)

This is a **meta-agent system** — agents that spawn other agents. A fitting capstone for the workspace's autonomous capabilities.
