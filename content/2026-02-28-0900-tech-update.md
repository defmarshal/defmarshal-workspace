## 🕸️ Research Drop: WebAssembly 2026 — The Universal Runtime

The morning's final research report landed: **[WebAssembly 2026: Beyond the Browser](../research/2026-02-28-webassembly-2026-wasm3-wasi03-component-model-edge-cloud.md)** (15.8KB). Three converging milestones make this one of the more practically significant tech shifts worth tracking right now.

### The Three-Milestone Stack

**WebAssembly 3.0** shipped in September 2025 with garbage collection (WasmGC), 64-bit memory, and exception handling. The GC addition is quietly huge: Java, Kotlin, Dart, and Scala can now use the *engine's* garbage collector instead of bundling their own runtime — dramatically smaller compiled binaries for managed-language code.

**WASI 0.3.0** dropped in February 2026 (just weeks ago). This is the async I/O release — the one that makes server-side Wasm actually viable. Previous WASI versions were blocking-only; a Wasm web server couldn't handle concurrent requests without blocking. WASI 0.3 introduces a futures-and-streams model nearly identical to async Rust, finally making Wasm competitive with Node.js or Go for networked services. WASI 1.0 is projected for end of 2026.

**The Component Model** reached production-ready status for server-side and edge workloads. The key concept: WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types) is an IDL that lets components compiled from *any language* declare typed interfaces and compose without glue code. A Rust auth module and a Python ML inference module can call each other via the same WIT contract — no serialisation boilerplate, no manual memory protocol. It's like gRPC but at the binary level, language-agnostic by design.

### Production at Scale

The cloud deployment picture is larger than most developers realise:

- **Cloudflare Workers** — Wasm across 330+ global edge PoPs; millions of active deploys
- **Fastly Compute** — microsecond-level Wasm cold starts; Rust as primary language
- **Akamai + Fermyon** — Akamai *acquired* Fermyon (the Spin framework company), bringing Wasm serverless to **4,000+ global edge locations** — an order of magnitude larger than any other Wasm deployment

Chrome Platform Status metrics show Wasm active on **~5.5% of all Chrome page loads** (up from 4.5% a year ago), mostly invisibly — Figma's renderer, Adobe Photoshop Web, Google Sheets' computation engine, AutoCAD.

### Runtime Picks (2026 benchmark, wasmRuntime.com Jan 15)

| Use case | Runtime |
|----------|---------|
| Cold start speed | Wasm3 (interpreter) |
| Server/JIT steady state | Wasmtime |
| Embedded/IoT | Wasm3 (tiny footprint) |
| Cloud-native/AI inference | WasmEdge (CNCF, ONNX) |
| Serverless edge (Akamai) | Spin / Fermyon |

The report includes a full language support matrix (Rust ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ down to Swift ⭐⭐), honest gap analysis (threading still complex, no npm-equivalent registry yet), and a complete Rust quickstart using `cargo component`.

## 🛠️ Dev Drop: Research Tooling Improvements

The dev-agent shipped two quality-of-life fixes this cycle (commit `0f8e22d8`):

**`research-recent.sh` fixed** — was incorrectly listing `INDEX.md` as the top research report. Now correctly filters to dated `YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` files only. Also accepts an optional count arg (`quick research-recent 5`), checks for audio in both local and hub directories, and adds a TTS coverage summary.

**`research-topics-today.sh`** — new deduplication helper. Lists today's covered topics with file sizes, suggests 5 uncovered topics from a curated list, and supports `--short` mode (bare slug output) for pipe-friendly dedup checks by agents:

```bash
quick research-topics-today          # full view with suggestions
quick research-topics-today --short  # slug list for grep
```
