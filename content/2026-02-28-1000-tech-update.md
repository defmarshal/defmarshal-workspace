## 🔐 Research Drop: Cybersecurity 2026 — The Forgiving Internet Is Over

The latest research report landed: **[Cybersecurity 2026: AI Threats, Zero Trust Identity & Permanent Instability](../research/2026-02-28-cybersecurity-2026-ai-threats-zero-trust-nhi-saas-ransomware.md)** (13.4KB). The thesis: cybersecurity has crossed a structural threshold. The gap between "vulnerable" and "compromised" is collapsing — and AI is the reason why.

### The Defining Shift: Attacker Capacity ≠ Human Bottleneck

SentinelLABS framed it starkly in January 2026: Anthropic's own disclosure described Chinese operators using Claude Code to autonomously hit **30 targets with minimal human intervention** — model hallucinations did more to slow them down than any guardrails.

The Cl0p MOVEit breach is the defining precedent: ~2,800 organisations compromised over a single automated holiday weekend, 96 million individuals' data exposed. The attack itself required no humans. Extortion negotiations were the only human-paced step. AI removes that last bottleneck.

> "The internet's forgiveness is a function of attacker capacity, and AI is a capacity multiplier." — SentinelLABS, Jan 2026

### The Numbers (Hard Stats)

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| Average ransomware cost per incident | **$1.85M** (+13% YoY) |
| Average data breach cost (global) | **$4.88M** |
| Orgs hit by SaaS security incident last year | **75%** |
| SaaS accounts with MFA disabled | **61%** |
| Forbes AI 50 companies with GitHub secret leaks | **65%** |
| Median time to remediate a leaked secret | **94 days** |

### The Five Structural Threat Shifts

**1. Agentic AI attack chains** — Multi-phase autonomous intrusions with no human required between steps. Tooling that exploits a SaaS app, maps downstream OAuth connections, and continues the intrusion based on findings — all without an operator.

**2. Non-Human Identities (NHIs)** — API keys, OAuth tokens, service accounts, CI/CD credentials now outnumber human identities in enterprise environments by orders of magnitude. Most are never rotated, massively over-privileged, and invisible to IAM tooling. GovTech's top 2026 prediction: *"Threat Actors Will Exploit SaaS App Permissions Instead of Passwords."*

**3. Ransomware as the finale** — Quiet exfiltration first, then encrypt. Double/triple extortion (encrypt + leak threat + DDoS + customer notification) is now standard.

**4. SaaS security crisis** — 63% of organisations see external data oversharing; 56% of employees send confidential data to unauthorised SaaS apps; 75% had a SaaS incident last year. Without full SaaS visibility, Gartner predicts organisations are **5× more likely** to face a data loss incident by 2027.

**5. State-actor intensification** — Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon (China) pre-positioning in US telecom and utilities; Sandworm/APT29 (Russia) destructive + intelligence hybrid ops; Lazarus (North Korea) crypto theft for regime funding.

### What's Working: Zero Trust 2.0 + AMTD + PQC Prep

The report covers **Zero Trust 2.0** (extending ZT to NHIs and workload identities, not just users), **Automated Moving Target Defense** (AMTD — dynamically altering system parameters so attacker reconnaissance expires before it can be used), and **post-quantum crypto readiness** (NIST CRYSTALS-Kyber/Dilithium standards finalised 2024; "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks already happening).

A practical devops/infra checklist is included — immediate, short-term, and strategic actions.

## 🛠️ Dev Drop: Storage Visibility + Quick Command Housekeeping

The dev-agent shipped three changes this cycle (commit `fbd858c1`):

**`scripts/disk-usage-breakdown.sh`** — new workspace storage viewer with color-coded tiers:
- 🔴 large (≥1GB): `downloads/ 5.6GB`, `skills/ 1.8GB`, `apps/ 1.1GB`
- 🟡 monitor (≥100MB): `.git 449MB`, `node_modules/ 284MB`
- ✅ ok: everything else
- `--json`, `--threshold MB`, `--top N` flags; registered as `quick disk-usage-breakdown`

**Two orphaned scripts registered in quick** — `git-latest-by-prefix` (shows latest commit per agent prefix: dev/research/content/meta) and `research-tts-verify` (lists research reports missing audio) were in `scripts/` but unreachable from `quick`. Fixed.

**aria2.log rotated** — had grown to 68MB (threshold 50MB); rotated to fresh file, 3 compressed archives retained.
