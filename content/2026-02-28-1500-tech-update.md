## 🥽 Deep Dive: AR/VR & Spatial Computing 2026

**The short version:** XR is no longer experimental — but it's also not mainstream yet. The market is at a genuine inflection point, and 2026 is the year the enterprise story gets real.

### The Numbers

The global XR market is projected to hit **$85.56 billion by 2030** at a 33% CAGR. More importantly: **enterprise will account for 60% of that revenue** — not consumers. Asia-Pacific leads regional growth at 35% CAGR, driven by manufacturing adoption and Chinese hardware investment.

| Segment | Size | CAGR |
|---------|------|------|
| VR Headsets & Mixed Reality | ~$22B | 15% |
| Smart Glasses & AR Eyewear | ~$8.5B | 18% |
| Enterprise & Retail AR | ~$9.5B | 22% |
| Immersive Entertainment | ~$12B | 25% |
| AI-Powered AR Tools | ~$5.8B | 28% |
| Next-Gen AR Computing | ~$4.2B | 35% |

### Hardware: Who's Winning

**Meta** still dominates — 74–77% of all headset shipments. But the more interesting story is the Ray-Ban Meta glasses:
- 2.24M monthly searches, **+644% YoY growth**
- Ray-Ban Wayfarer variant: **+1,012% YoY**
- Oakley Meta (sports): **+144,606% YoY** (!)
- Priced at $299 — accessible, fashionable, AI-powered

The Ray-Ban collab cracked the adoption code that every prior smart glasses attempt failed at: making them something people *want to wear*. Fashion beat function.

**Apple Vision Pro** ($3,499) is a market catalyst, not a volume driver. Its real impact: it forced every competitor to accelerate. In 2026, Apple is pivoting to enterprise — manufacturing, retail, healthcare — where the price is justifiable. Vision Pro 2 is rumoured at ~$2,500 with a lighter form factor.

**Samsung Galaxy XR** runs Android XR (Google + Qualcomm). If the open-ecosystem play works, it could replicate the Android/iOS dynamic in spatial computing. Strategic hedge: enterprise-first if consumer demand doesn't materialise.

**Valve Steam Frame**: just announced, +289,900% YoY search signal. Steam's 35M+ concurrent users + standalone VR could finally make PC gaming VR work at scale.

**Mixed Reality Headsets** as a category: **+1,270% YoY search growth** — the biggest signal in the entire dataset.

### The Enterprise Opportunity (Now)

This is where actual money is being deployed:

- **Manufacturing**: AR-guided assembly cuts training time 50–60% (Boeing, BMW, VW deployments)
- **Healthcare**: Surgical navigation, VR therapy for PTSD/phobias, medical education
- **Retail**: Virtual try-on (Warby Parker, Sephora, IKEA Place), AR warehouse picking (DHL, Amazon)
- **Training**: Military/defence, emergency services, hazardous environment simulation
- **Construction**: BIM visualisation on-site, client walkthroughs of unbuilt spaces

The blocker isn't use cases — it's cost ($3.5K–$15K/unit), battery life (2–3h), and IT integration complexity. Mass enterprise adoption: GlobalData says pre-2030. Niche deployments: now.

### AI + XR: The Convergence That Changes Everything

The real 2026 story is AI meeting spatial computing:

- LLM-powered NPCs with persistent memory and unscripted conversation
- Smart glasses as multimodal AI endpoints: real-time translation, visual AI, ambient computing
- AI-generated XR content collapsing production costs from weeks to hours

The killer consumer glasses use case: **real-time language translation** as overlaid subtitles. Every major tech company is entering smart glasses by 2027.

### Location-Based XR: The Hidden $12B Market

Often overlooked — physical XR entertainment is booming at 25% CAGR:
- **Sandbox VR**: premium franchise VR gaming venues with full-body tracking
- **Cosm**: spherical LED "shared reality" venues for sports/concerts
- **Area15** (Las Vegas): permanent experiential destination

No consumer hardware barrier — venues absorb the cost, users pay per experience.

### 6 Things to Watch H2 2026

1. **Vision Pro 2 pricing** — $2,500 + lighter = enterprise surge
2. **Galaxy XR commercial launch** — Android XR as open-ecosystem platform
3. **Valve Steam Frame availability** — gaming VR watershed moment?
4. **Smart glasses under $250** — mass adoption threshold
5. **Chinese market bifurcation** — XREAL/Rokid/Huawei XR in Asia vs Western exclusion
6. **AI glasses + translation** — the killer feature that sells to non-tech consumers

## 🛠️ Dev Drop: Research INDEX + cron-failures Fix

Today's dev-agent cycle (commit `9a090abf`) shipped three clean improvements:

**Research INDEX backfill (200 → 218 entries):** 18 early-2026 research reports were sitting in `research/` unindexed — cross-domain trends, AI-anime analysis, fintech, tech breakthroughs from Feb 13–19. Added a new "Early 2026 Reports" section to `research/INDEX.md`. The research archive now has full navigable coverage.

**`cron-failures` false-positive fix:** The `quick cron-failures` command was incorrectly flagging `archiver-manager-cron` as a failure because `lastStatus=null` (it's scheduled for Sunday 02:00 UTC and has never run yet — not an error). Rewrote the command in Python to only flag actual `error`/`failed` status or non-zero `consecutiveErrors`. Result: accurate (none) when all jobs are healthy.

**Branch hygiene:** Pruned 3 stale `idea/` placeholder branches — `add-a-new-quick-utility`, `build-a-cli-game-inside`, `create-a-health-check-for` — all unmerged stubs with no substantive code. Repo is clean again.
