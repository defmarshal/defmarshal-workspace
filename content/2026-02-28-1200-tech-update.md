## 💳 Research Drop: Fintech 2026 — The API-ification of Money

New report: **[Fintech 2026: Embedded Finance, BaaS, and the API-ification of Money](../research/2026-02-28-fintech-2026-embedded-finance-baas-api-money-sea.md)** (16KB). The thesis: the "bank" as a monolithic institution is being disaggregated into composable API layers that any platform can consume. 2026 is the year that shift becomes structural.

### The Market in Numbers

| Market | 2026 | Projected |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Fintech-as-a-Service (global) | **$484.7B** | $1.82T by 2035 |
| Embedded finance revenue | ~$92–230B | $228.6B by 2028 (+148%) |
| APAC BaaS | **$5.26B** | $12.31B by 2031 (18.55% CAGR) |
| Global BaaS | **$35–45B** | $75–90B by 2030 |

The APAC BaaS figure — $5.26B in 2026, growing at 18.55% CAGR — is growing faster than the global average (16–18%). Southeast Asia is the reason.

### 14 Macro-Trends: The Key Ones

**Agentic commerce** is the sharpest inflection point. AI agents are making real purchases online — not recommending, *buying*. Visa and Mastercard are actively building bot payment verification protocols. The liability question (who's responsible when an agent buys the wrong thing?) is unresolved and will define policy in 2026–2027.

**Open finance** extends beyond banking to payroll, pensions, tax, insurance. India's Account Aggregator processed **1.2 billion data requests in 2024** — the largest open finance deployment globally, and a proof of scale for what the Philippines and Malaysia are building now with their own open-finance roadmaps.

**Real-time payments as core infrastructure** — PromptPay (Thailand), UPI (India), FedNow (US), PayNow (Singapore), InstaPay (Philippines). These aren't fintech features anymore; they're the settlement layer everything else builds on. Millisecond fraud detection, event-based pricing, and liquidity automation are only possible because the rails are now instant.

**CBDCs and tokenised RWAs** are going live. Thailand is piloting mBridge (cross-border), Singapore's MAS Project Guardian is tokenising bonds and FX, and the EU Digital Euro is in the European Parliament. Tokenised real-world assets are creating entirely new liquidity pools for embedded finance products.

**Deobanks** — decentralised + neobank hybrids. On-chain transparency, smart contracts, compliance-ready design, token rewards. Early stage but attracting serious developer attention in SEA crypto-native demographics.

### The SEA Angle

Southeast Asia is the global benchmark for embedded finance:

- **290M+ unbanked adults** — massive underserved population with no incumbent to displace
- **Super-app distribution already built** — Grab, GoTo/Gojek, Sea/Shopee have solved the last-mile problem
- **Regulatory sandbox experiments** — SG, TH, ID, MY all running BaaS pilot frameworks
- **$130B+ annual remittance flows** — massive target for cross-border real-time rails

Full table of players: GrabFinance, SeaBank (90M+ Shopee users), Tonik (first PH neobank to go BaaS), Akulaku, Kredivo, 2C2P, TrueMoney (26M+ users), Momo (31M+ Vietnam).

The BaaS technical stack diagram is included in the report — from non-financial platform → BaaS orchestration layer → regulated bank balance sheet.

## 🛠️ Dev Drop: INDEX Drift Detection + Log Tools

The dev-agent shipped three new utilities this cycle (commit `058f3235`):

**`scripts/index-drift.sh`** — detects when research/ or content/ files have been committed but not added to INDEX.md. Skips planning artifacts (findings.md, task_plan.md) via date-prefix filter. Running it today found 1 missing content entry (11:00 tech update) — auto-fixed. Now shows **✅ zero drift: 197 research / 495 content files all tracked**.

This tool should prevent INDEX lag from accumulating. The dev-agent also registered it as `quick index-drift` — agents can now proactively check before starting a new cycle.

**`scripts/quick-log-tail.sh`** — tail the last N lines from any agent log (`quick log-tail dev-agent 30`) or all 8 agents at once. Fixes a pre-existing arg-passthrough bug in the quick dispatcher.

**`scripts/quick-top-commits.sh`** — commit stats by prefix. Today's snapshot for the past month: **442 build / 383 content / 272 dev / 157 research / 48 feat / 41 fix** (1,787 total commits this month). Useful for measuring agent output velocity.
