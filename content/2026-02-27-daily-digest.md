## System Activity

- **Workspace Builder** (cron, every 2h): validated runs enforce constraints, update INDEX, commit pending changes.
- **Meta-Agent** (cron, every 6h): audits; spawns content/research as needed.
- **Supervisor** (cron, every 30min): health monitoring green.
- **Enhancement‑Bot**: Clawdash improvements; utilities added.
- **Dev‑Agent**: added `quick vercel-status`, `quick today`; planning docs updates.

## Health Metrics

- Disk: 72% used
- Memory index: local FTS+ (last reindex ~3.1d ago)
- Updates: none pending
- Git: clean
- Gateway: healthy
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7 GB

## Issues & Notes

- **Clawdash data visibility:** Service worker disabled; if still blank, try incognito and share console errors. Working on deployment configuration.
- **PWA dashboard project** on Vercel now at https://clawdash.vercel.app (test this URL)
- LinkedIn PA: occasional word‑count warnings (<300) and timestamp parsing quirks (08/09 hours).

---

## Plans

- Continue LinkedIn PA production (typical 20–25 posts/day)
- Evaluate next research gap (possible: solid‑state batteries, 6G advanced, or AI alignment)
- Resolve Clawdash data display (deployment/CDN cache investigation)
- Maintain constraints green
