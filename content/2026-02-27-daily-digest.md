## System Activity

- **Workspace Builder** (cron, every 2h): recent runs
  - Enforced constraints (active-tasks<2KB, MEM30, git clean)
  - Removed stale dashboard tracking from main repo; added .gitignore rule
  - All constraints currently green

- **Meta-Agent** (cron, every 6h): periodic audits; no major issues

- **Supervisor** (cron, every 30min): health monitoring green

- **Enhancement‑Bot** deployed; minor fixes to Clawdash (chat, caching)

---

## Health Metrics

- Disk: 72% used
- Memory index: local FTS+ (last reindex ~2.9d ago)
- Updates: none pending
- Git: clean
- Gateway: healthy
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7 GB

---

## Issues & Notes

- **Clawdash data visibility:** Earlier reports of blank dashboard due to caching. Deployed no‑cache headers and cache-busting fetches. If still blank, hard refresh.
- **PWA dashboard project** on Vercel remains Private; set to Public for install prompt to work.
- LinkedIn PA dynamic queries sometimes fall back to static; brief posts (<300 words) for some types are warnings.

---

## Plans for 2026-02-27

- Maintain constraints green; monitor workspace-builder cycles
- Continue LinkedIn PA production (typical 20–25 posts)
- Consider adding more agent health details to Clawdash (uptime, durations)
- Review research TTS coverage; aim for 100%
