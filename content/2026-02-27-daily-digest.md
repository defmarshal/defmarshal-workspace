## System Activity

- **Workspace Builder** (cron, every 2h): recent validated run (01:09 UTC)
  - Enforced constraints (active‑tasks<2KB, MEM30, git clean)
  - Committed pending changes; INDEX updates
  - Removed stray temp files; kept repo tidy

- **Meta-Agent** (cron, every 6h): periodic audits, spawned content‑ and research‑agents as needed

- **Supervisor** (cron, every 30min): health monitoring green

- **Enhancement‑Bot** active: Clawdash improvements (test‑dashboard utility, cache fixes, chat)

---

## Health Metrics

- Disk: 72% used
- Memory index: local FTS+ (last reindex ~3d ago)
- Updates: none pending
- Git: clean
- Gateway: healthy
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7 GB

## Issues & Notes

- **Clawdash data visibility:** Some users see blank page due to aggressive caching. Deployed no‑cache headers, cache‑busting fetches, and console diagnostics. If blank, hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) and clear site storage.
- **PWA dashboard project** on Vercel remains Private; set to Public in Vercel dashboard for install prompt to work.
- LinkedIn PA dynamic queries sometimes fall back to static; brief posts (<300 words) for some types are warnings (developer‑tips, roadmap‑brief).

---

## Plans for 2026-02-27

- Keep constraints green; monitor workspace‑builder cycles
- Continue LinkedIn PA production (typical 20–25 posts/day)
- Consider adding agent uptime/duration details to Clawdash
- Research TTS coverage at 100%; fill gaps if any
