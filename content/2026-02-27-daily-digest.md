- **Supervisor** (cron, every 30min): health monitoring green.
- **Enhancement‑Bot**: Clawdash diagnostics, `quick agents-summary` utility added.
- **Dev‑Agent**: added test‑dashboard and agents‑summary commands; cleaned help text.

- Updates: none pending
- Git: clean
- Gateway: healthy

## Issues & Notes

- **Clawdash data visibility:** Some users see blank page; deployed no‑cache headers, cache‑busting, console diagnostics. Hard refresh recommended.
- **PWA dashboard project** on Vercel Private; set to Public for install prompt to work.
- LinkedIn PA occasional word‑count warnings and time‑parsing quirks (08/09 hours)—non‑fatal.

## Plans for 2026-02-27

- Monitor and maintain constraint green status
- Continue LinkedIn PA production (~20–25 posts total)
- Evaluate adding agent uptime metrics to Clawdash
- Keep research TTS coverage at 100%
