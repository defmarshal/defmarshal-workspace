### Research

- `research/2026-02-27-spring-2026-anime-season-trends.md`
  - Spring 2026 anime preview: My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer, Spy x Family, Vinland Saga, Sakamoto Days, Witch Hat Atelier, Kagurabachi; streaming guide (Crunchyroll, Netflix); industry trends; episode counts and studio details.

- `research/2026-02-27-leo-satellite-internet-constellations-2026-status-update.md`
  - Starlink (9k+ satellites, 6M+ users, $120/mo residential, price cuts Jan 2026), OneWeb (enterprise B2B, ~648 sats, 150–195 Mbps), Project Kuiper (pre‑launch, enterprise preview; consumer mid‑2026). Competitive dynamics and technology trends.

- `research/2026-02-27-real-time-payments-digital-banking-transformation-2026.md`
  - Real‑time payments volume $22T (2024) → $58T (2028); RTP adoption in US (RTP, FedNow), EU (SEPA Instant price parity), India (UPI $2.9T). Stablecoins enter enterprise treasury; CBDC projections $213B by 2030; neobank slowdown; programmable payments APIs; vendor consolidation.

- `research/2026-02-27-quantum-networking-quantum-internet-2026-QKD-networks-standards-scaling.md`
  - QKD deployments: China Beijing‑Shanghai 2000 km, EU MadQCI (SDN‑controlled, multivendor), UK networks. Trusted‑node vs entanglement‑based architectures. ETSI ISG QKD standards (use cases, APIs, SDN control). Challenges: photon loss, quantum repeaters not mature, cost, skill gap. Outlook: 2026 turning point for production‑grade QKD, but widespread adoption 5–10 years away.

## System Activity

- **Workspace Builder** (cron, every 2h): validated runs enforce constraints (active‑tasks<2KB, MEM30, git clean), update INDEX, commit pending changes, remove temp files.
  - Recent cleanup: removed stray `enhancement-bot.pid` and temp JSON; added `.gitignore` entries; committed planning docs updates (Phase 4 completion) and enhancement‑bot daemon improvements.
- **Meta‑Agent** (cron, every 6h): audits; spawns content‑ and research‑agents as needed.
- **Supervisor** (cron, every 30min): health monitoring green.
- **Enhancement‑Bot**: Clawdash improvements (cache‑busting, no‑cache headers, chat, error overlays), added `quick test-dashboard` and `quick agents-summary` utilities.
- **Dev‑Agent**: added `quick log-tail` utility; cleaned help text; pushed commits with `dev:`/`chore:` prefixes.

## Health Metrics

- Disk: 72% used
- Memory index: local FTS+ (last reindex ~3d ago)
- Updates: none pending
- Git: clean
- Gateway: healthy
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7 GB

---

## Issues & Notes

- **Clawdash data visibility:** Some users see blank page; deployed no‑cache headers, cache‑busting, console diagnostics. If blank, hard refresh (Ctrl+F5/Cmd+Shift+R) and clear site storage / unregister service worker.
- **PWA dashboard project** on Vercel remains Private; set to Public in Vercel dashboard for install prompt to work.
- LinkedIn PA occasional word‑count warnings (<300 words) and timestamp parsing (08/09 hours) — non‑fatal; script already uses base‑10 safe arithmetic but some edge cases may remain.

## Plans for 2026-02-28 (overnight)

- Continue LinkedIn PA production (typical 20–25 posts/day)
- Evaluate research watchlist for next high‑value gap (possible: 6G, neuromorphic chips, space launch economics, fusion energy milestones)
- Consider adding agent uptime/duration metrics to Clawdash
- Maintain constraints green; monitor workspace‑builder cycles
