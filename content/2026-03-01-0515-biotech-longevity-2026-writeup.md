# The Drug That Changes Everything: Biotech in 2026

**Date:** 2026-03-01 | **Category:** Technology / Biotech | **Reading time:** ~6 min

Something unusual happened in pharmaceutical history over the past three years: a drug class that started as a diabetes treatment became the biggest commercial story in medicine. GLP-1 receptor agonists — Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Zepbound — have reshuffled the entire biopharma industry's strategic priorities. But that's only one thread in a much larger story about how 2026 became an inflection year for biotechnology.

Here are the four things actually defining the sector right now.

## 1. AI Drug Discovery Is Now Infrastructure, Not Experiment

The most significant shift in biopharma over the past two years isn't any single drug. It's the change in how drugs get discovered in the first place.

In November 2024, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to Demis Hassabis, John Jumper, and David Baker for AlphaFold — the AI system that predicted the structure of **over 200 million proteins**, more than all of experimental biology had produced in the preceding century. In February 2026, **Isomorphic Labs** (Alphabet's drug-design spinout, led by Hassabis) announced an update to their drug-design system that more than doubled AlphaFold 3's performance on the hardest molecular interaction cases.

This isn't academic. Better protein structure prediction means faster identification of drug candidates. Isomorphic Labs signed commercial deals worth up to **$3 billion** with Eli Lilly and Novartis in early 2024 — the first time a major pharma bet that amount on an AI-native drug design partnership.

The clearest proof point so far: **Insilico Medicine** used its Chemistry42 AI platform to identify a drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in **18 months** — a process that conventionally takes four to six years. That drug reached Phase 2 clinical trials and reported **positive topline results in November 2025**. The first fully AI-designed drug at Phase 2 with encouraging data.

At scale, industry estimates suggest AI could contribute **$100 billion annually** to the global economy through improved drug discovery by 2030, and reduce R&D costs by 20–30%. The investment is following that logic: **$15 billion** funded cell and gene therapy programs in 2025 alone.

## 2. GLP-1: The Oral Race Is Now the Real Battle

GLP-1 drugs — the injectable weekly treatments that produce substantial weight loss — already dominate pharmaceutical headlines. Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 products (Ozempic + Wegovy) exceeded **$20 billion in combined revenue in 2024**, making it the largest pharmaceutical company in Europe by market cap almost overnight. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) — a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist showing greater weight loss than semaglutide in head-to-head data — is fast becoming the primary competitor.

But the 2026 story is about what comes next: **oral GLP-1**.

The injectable format creates barriers — cost, storage requirements, patient comfort with weekly injections. A once-daily pill with comparable efficacy would expand the addressable market dramatically. Eli Lilly's **orforglipron** completed a Phase 3 trial showing statistically and clinically significant weight loss over 72 weeks in adults with obesity. Filing expected in 2026. Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, and multiple other companies have competing programs at various stages.

Beyond weight loss, the indications are expanding into territory that could reshape multiple markets simultaneously:
- **Cardiovascular:** The SELECT trial showed Wegovy reducing major cardiac events by 20%
- **Sleep apnoea:** FDA approved Wegovy for obstructive sleep apnoea in December 2024
- **Chronic kidney disease:** Phase 3 data emerging
- **Alzheimer's disease:** Phase 3 trial ongoing (semaglutide for AD)
- **Addiction:** Early Phase 2 signals in alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder

Analysts describe GLP-1 drugs as potentially becoming **some of the most commercially significant therapies in pharmaceutical history** — not because of the weight loss alone, but because reducing obesity systematically reduces costs across cardiovascular, diabetic, orthopaedic, and other disease categories across entire health systems.

## 3. CRISPR Has Gone From Proof-of-Concept to Patient Treatment

In December 2023, the FDA approved **Casgevy** — the first CRISPR-based therapy, developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. By 2024, European approval followed. The patients treated to date show no symptoms. It is, functionally, a cure. The price is ~$2.2 million per patient in the US.

The FDA now has **46+ approved cell and gene therapy products**. A new "plausible mechanism" pathway was introduced to fast-track highly personalised treatments. The pipeline for 2026 is substantial — hundreds of active IND applications, multiple Phase 3 trials expected to read out this year.

**Beam Therapeutics** treated the first patient in a base-editing clinical trial in 2023 — a more precise CRISPR variant that changes single DNA letters without double-strand cuts, reducing off-target effects. Multiple Phase 1/2 programs are ongoing in 2026. The next-generation CAR-T cell therapies are now targeting solid tumours rather than only blood cancers, expanding the patient population considerably.

The economic question for gene therapy is the same one that has always limited it: manufacturing scale and reimbursement. One-time cures at $2–3 million per patient strain every payment model. But the regulatory pathway is now clear, the manufacturing infrastructure is maturing, and the data is real.

## 4. The Patent Cliff Is Forcing the Industry to Bet on the Future

Here's the structural context that explains every M&A deal and every AI partnership you'll read about in biopharma news this year: **$176 billion in annual drug revenue will lose patent protection by 2029**.

The top 20 drugs losing exclusivity over the next six years collectively generated $176 billion in 2024 sales. That's 75% of all revenue at risk disappearing from the balance sheets of the companies that currently hold it. Over 40% of big pharma revenue is at stake.

This is why Pfizer paid up to **$10 billion for Metsera** (an obesity drug developer). Why GSK acquired RAPT Therapeutics for **$2.2 billion**. Why ING is forecasting M&A volume up 15% in 2026. Why every major pharma company is either building an AI drug discovery capability internally or signing large external partnerships.

The urgency is real and the math is simple: the pipelines need to be refilled before the cliff hits, and conventional drug discovery timelines — 10 to 15 years from target identification to approval — are too slow to solve a problem that arrives in 2026–2029. AI-accelerated discovery, with its promise of compressing that timeline by up to 50%, is no longer a research experiment. It's a competitive survival tool.

## What to Watch in 2026

The data points that will define the second half of the year:

- **Orforglipron Phase 3 filing** — If Eli Lilly's oral GLP-1 performs as expected, it creates a competitor to Novo Nordisk in a format that dramatically expands the market
- **Insilico Medicine Phase 2 readout** — Full data on the first AI-designed drug in Phase 2 positive; the result shapes how quickly AI drug discovery gets funded at scale
- **CRISPR Phase 3 entries** — Multiple therapies moving from Phase 1/2 toward pivotal trials; sickle cell and beta-thalassemia data from Casgevy's expanded patient population
- **M&A acceleration** — The patent cliff acquirers with capital and urgency are actively hunting late-stage assets; expect significant deals in oncology, metabolic, and rare disease
- **GLP-1 cardiovascular data** — Multiple trials reading out on whether the cardiometabolic benefits of GLP-1 drugs justify reimbursement at scale for primary prevention

The through-line across all of these is the same: 2026 is the year biotech stops being primarily about what *might* work and becomes primarily about what *is* working, at what cost, and at what scale. The science has arrived. The execution is what's being tested now.
