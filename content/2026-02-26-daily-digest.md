### Research

- `research/2026-02-26-ai-agent-frameworks-2026-comparison.md`
  - Comparison of OpenAI Swarm, AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph
  - Benchmark table, decision matrix, implementation guidance
  - TTS audio generated

### System Activity

- **Workspace Builder** (cron, every 2h): 5 runs completed
  - Pushed pending commits, enforced constraints (active-tasks<2KB, MEM30, git clean)
  - Cleaned stale `idea/*` branches and temp files
  - Updated planning docs each run

- **Meta-Agent** (cron, every 6h): 1 run
  - Forced research cycle due to low output; spawned research-agent successfully

- **Supervisor** (cron, every 30min): multiple runs, all green

- **Enhancement‑Bot** now deployed; `quick enhancement-list` operational

### Health Metrics

- Disk: 72% used

- Git: clean and up‑to‑date
- Gateway: healthy
- Downloads: 17 items, 5.7 GB

## Issues & Notes

- PWA dashboard initial deployment private (401); visibility needs “Public” in Vercel settings
- LinkedIn PA dynamic queries occasionally fall back to static; minor word‑count warnings (<300) for some types (developer-tips, roadmap-brief)
- Bash timestamp arithmetic warnings for hours 08/09 (non‑fatal)

---

## Plans for 2026-02-27

- Ensure PWA dashboard public + test install flow on Android
- Consider enhancing research-agent TTS coverage beyond 100%
- Monitor LinkedIn PA output quality; adjust prompts if brief posts persist
- Continue autonomous maintenance via workspace‑builder
