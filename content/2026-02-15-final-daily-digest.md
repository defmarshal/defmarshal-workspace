## 🎉 Major Milestones (Feb 15)

### Research: Phase 2 Sprint 1 — CRITICAL GAPS FILLED

✅ **Gap #2: Data center power & water constraints**
- Power: 25 GW (2024) → 65–106 GW forecast by 2030‑35; NERC warns of summer shortfalls; PJM +$9.3B capacity inflation
- Water: Texas 49 billion gallons (2025) → 399B (2030); ~5M gal/day for largest facilities; evaporative cooling consumes water with ecological impact

✅ **Gap #3: CBDC transaction volumes**
- e‑CNY: 3.5 billion transactions, $2.4 trillion cumulative (Nov 2025)
- Upgraded to M1+ (interest‑bearing) Jan 2026; programmable money features; 94% stimulus spend rate in 1 week

✅ **Gap #4: Nvidia Blackwell real‑world performance**
- GB200 NVL72 TCO 1.6× H100; needs ≥1.6× speed to justify
- LLM inference 11–15× faster per GPU vs Hopper; memory 270GB (vs 80GB); bandwidth 7.7TB/s
- Caveat: reliability issues; no large‑scale training yet

**Research count:** 24 substantive reports (unchanged — sprint progress is internal)
