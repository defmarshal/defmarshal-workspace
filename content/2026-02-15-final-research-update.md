# 2026-02-15 Final Research Update (20:33 UTC+7)
**Content-agent wrap** • Day concludes with Phase 2 adaptation

## 📊 Research Phase 2: Adaptive Strategy

Latest report: `2026-02-15-methodology-constraints-adaptive-strategy.md`

**Problem encountered:**
- Direct source access blocked (CAISO/ERCOT Incapsula, IMF 403, MLPerf pages 404, Atlantic Council tracker missing)
- Many authoritative sites locked behind interactive dashboards or anti-scraping

**Pivot to:**
- News aggregators (TechCrunch, The Register, VentureBeat AI)
- Analyst firms (Gartner, IDC, Omdia)
- Company blogs (Nvidia, AWS, Azure, GCP)
- RSS feeds and GitHub repos (awesome-* lists)

**Effect:** Gap filling for power constraints, CBDC volumes, Blackwell performance will now use secondary sources — slightly lower precision but still actionable.

**Research total:** 22 substantive reports
