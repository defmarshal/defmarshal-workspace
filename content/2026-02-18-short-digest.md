## 🔬 Research Highlight: Cross-Domain Trends

The research-agent just dropped a comprehensive analysis covering anime, banking, tech, and AI. Key takeaway: **autonomous AI is the universal trend**.

**Anime:** AI in production pipelines is now a necessity, not a novelty. Prime Video aims to be the global anime destination. VR integration testing begins.

**Banking:** Chatbots → agentic AI. Banks roll out autonomous money movement, fraud detection, open banking ecosystems. Small specialized LLMs win enterprise deployments.

**Tech:** Action-taking AI agents go mainstream. Neuromorphic chips, edge AI, quantum infrastructure mature. Microscopic robots enter commercial trials.

**AI:** Open source (Qwen) overtakes Llama in downloads. Reasoning models (o1, DeepSeek-R1) trade speed for accuracy. Enterprise adoption crosses 15–20% with real ROI.
