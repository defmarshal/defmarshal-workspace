## Research (Gemini CLI)

Based on the provided code, the current balance has a "mathematical trap": with 5 staff at ¥2,000/week, you spend ¥100,000 over 10 weeks (your entire starting budget), but current fan gains are linear (~2,500/ep), making the 50,000 fan win condition impossible without extreme RNG luck.

Here are three specific improvements to fix the balance:

### 1. Link Staff Count to Production Speed
**ISSUE:** Currently, staff members are purely a financial drain. There is no code that uses the `staff` variable to speed up `episodes_completed`, meaning the optimal strategy is to fire everyone immediately.

**FIX:** Introduce a `production_progress` variable and update the main loop (or the action handlers) to increment progress based on staff size.
```python
# Add to state (around line 25)
production_progress = 0.0 

# Replace episode_gain logic or call it conditionally
def work_on_episode():
    global production_progress, money, week
    # Each staff member contributes 20% toward an episode per week
    contribution = staff * 0.2 
    production_progress += contribution
    
    if production_progress >= 1.0:
        episode_gain() # Existing function
        production_progress -= 1.0
```
**RATIONALE:** This gives the player a reason to hire staff. More staff = faster episodes = reaching the win condition before running out of money.

### 2. Compounding Fan Growth (The "Hype" Factor)
**ISSUE:** To hit 50,000 fans in 10 episodes starting from 1,000, you need an average of 4,900 fans per episode. Your current formula (Line 172) maxes out around 2,500–3,000 even with upgrades. The game feels stagnant because growth is linear.

**FIX:** Modify the `gained` calculation in `episode_gain` (Line 172) to scale with your existing fanbase.
```python
# Line 172 - 176
def episode_gain():
    global fans, reputation, episodes_completed
    episodes_completed += 1
    
    # NEW: Base gain + 10% of existing fans (compounding growth)
    hype_bonus = int(fans * 0.10)
    base = fan_growth_base + (reputation - 50) * 20 + hype_bonus
    
    if "social_team" in studio_upgrades:
        base += 1000
        
    gained = max(200, base + random.randint(-200, 500))
    fans += gained
    # ... rest of function
```
**RATIONALE:** This simulates "word of mouth." Early episodes gain few fans, but later episodes "trend" harder because you already have a platform, making the 50k goal achievable through consistent play.

### 3. Reputation-Based Revenue (Streaming Payouts)
**ISSUE:** High reputation is currently just a "win check" at the end. There is no immediate economic benefit to making a "high quality" show versus a "trash" show, especially since `Quality Focus` (Choice 5) costs money.

**FIX:** Add a "Streaming Payout" to `episode_gain` that rewards high reputation.
```python
# Inside episode_gain()
def episode_gain():
    global money, reputation
    # ... existing fan logic ...
    
    # NEW: Payout scales with reputation (¥5,000 base + ¥200 per rep point)
    payout = 5000 + (reputation * 200)
    money += payout
    print(f"  {C.G}💰 Streaming Payout: +¥{payout:,}{C.E}")
```
**RATIONALE:** This creates a meaningful trade-off between `Rush episode` (low rep, fast fans) and `Quality focus` (high rep, more money). It allows the player to potentially offset the high salary costs of a large staff by maintaining a high-quality reputation.
