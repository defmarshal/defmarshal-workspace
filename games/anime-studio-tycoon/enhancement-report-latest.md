## Research (Gemini CLI)

To provide actionable improvements for **anime-studio-tycoon**, I have analyzed the current resource loops and progression mechanics. The following suggestions focus on adding strategic depth, specialized management, and dynamic replayability.

### 1. Market Trends & Genre System
*   **ISSUE**: Currently, every "show" is identical. There is no strategic decision-making regarding *what* kind of anime you are making, leading to a repetitive "numbers go up" experience.
*   **FIX**: Introduce a `genre` for the studio and a rotating `market_trend` that provides bonuses to Fan growth.
    
    **Add to State (approx. line 30):**
    ```python
    GENRES = ["Shonen", "Isekai", "Slice of Life", "Mecha", "Horror"]
    player_genre = "Shonen"  # Set during a new "Start Season" function
    market_trend = random.choice(GENRES)
    ```

    **Update `episode_gain()` (approx. line 166):**
    ```python
    def episode_gain():
        # ... existing code ...
        trend_mult = 1.5 if player_genre == market_trend else 1.0
        gained = int(max(200, base + random.randint(-200, 500)) * trend_mult)
        if trend_mult > 1.0:
            print(f"  {C.M}🔥 TREND BONUS: {player_genre} is hot right now!{C.E}")
        # ... rest of function ...
    ```
*   **RATIONALE**: This forces players to adapt their strategy. Investing in "Isekai" might be risky if the trend shifts to "Mecha," creating a meaningful choice between "playing it safe" vs. "chasing the meta."

### 2. Staff Productivity & "Crunch" Mechanic
*   **ISSUE**: Staff count is currently just a salary drain. There is no representation of the "Crunch Culture" prevalent in the industry, and the "Rush episode" choice (line 184) has no supporting logic in the snippet.
*   **FIX**: Replace the flat episode increment with a `production_points` system where staff count determines weekly progress. Add a "Crunch" mode that boosts progress at the cost of `reputation` and `morale`.

    **Add to State:**
    ```python
    production_progress = 0
    points_per_episode = 100
    is_crunching = False
    ```

    **New logic for the main loop (Integration):**
    ```python
    def process_week():
        global production_progress, episodes_completed, reputation
        
        # Calculate weekly progress based on staff
        weekly_gain = staff * 5
        if is_crunching:
            weekly_gain *= 2
            reputation -= 2
            print(f"  {C.R}⚠️ CRUNCH ACTIVE: Progress doubled, but staff is miserable.{C.E}")
            
        production_progress += weekly_gain
        
        if production_progress >= points_per_episode:
            production_progress -= points_per_episode
            episode_gain()
    ```
*   **RATIONALE**: This transforms staff from a "static cost" into a "production engine." It also gives the "Rush" choice a mechanical trade-off: speed up production to hit a deadline vs. preserving studio reputation.

### 3. Talent Specialization (Lead Roles)
*   **ISSUE**: Staff are treated as a fungible pool (just a number). There are no "hero" units or specialized hires that change how the studio operates.
*   **FIX**: Add a "Lead Director" or "Star Animator" upgrade/slot that provides unique global modifiers.

    **Add to `UPGRADES` (approx. line 62):**
    ```python
    "star_director": {
        "cost": 30_000, 
        "label": "Star Director", 
        "desc": "Reputation gain from episodes is doubled."
    },
    "god_animator": {
        "cost": 25_000, 
        "label": "God Animator", 
        "desc": "Reduces 'Staff burnout' event chance by 50%."
    }
    ```
*   **RATIONALE**: Upgrading from 5 to 6 staff feels incremental; hiring a "Star Director" feels like a milestone. It gives the player long-term "prestige" goals to aim for beyond the basic merch shops.
