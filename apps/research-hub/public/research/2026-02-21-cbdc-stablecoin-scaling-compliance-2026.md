## Executive Summary

Two critical infrastructure shifts are underway in digital finance:

- **CBDCs:** Only China's e-CNY has achieved true retail scale; others (India, Bahamas, Nigeria) remain modest. The digital euro will not launch until 2029 at earliest, with pilot in 2027. Most CBDCs are still in pilot phase with negligible transaction volume compared to cash.

- **Stablecoins:** USDC leads in regulatory compliance and cross-border utility (12% of stablecoin volume); Tether dominates by market cap but faces U.S. regulatory exclusion post-GENIUS Act. Stablecoin-issuing banks are emerging (JPMorgan, others), and MiCA will force transparency upgrades by July 2026.

The thesis that CBDCs are broadly scaling in 2025–2026 is **false**; only e-CNY has crossed the chasm. Stablecoins are gaining mainstream adoption faster, with compliance becoming a competitive moat.

## 1. CBDC Deployment: Who’s Actually Scaling?

### The Scaling Leader: China’s e‑CNY

- **Transaction Volume:** RMB 14.2 trillion (~$2 trillion) through September 2025, up from RMB 7.3 trillion in July 2024 — **nearly doubled in 14 months**.
- **Wallet Adoption:** 2.25 billion digital wallets (up from 180M in July 2024). With China’s population at 1.4B, many users hold multiple wallets.
- **Average Transaction Value:** ~RMB 428 ($60), stable since 2024; down from 2023 peak of RMB 1,895 ($135), indicating reduced business usage and more consumer payments.
- **Cross‑border mBridge:** China participates in a cross‑border CBDC pilot, but specific volumes are not disclosed.
- **Status:** Transitioned from pilot to early-stage implementation. The People’s Bank of China reports these figures as ongoing, not one‑off.

**Bottom line:** e-CNY is the only CBDC with **material transaction volume** and wallet penetration. It is already integrated into China’s payment ecosystem at scale.

### The Also‑Ran: India’s e‑Rupee

- **Circulation:** ₹10.16 billion ($122M) by March 2025, up 334% from ₹2.34B ($28M) in 2024.
- **Ranking:** Second‑largest CBDC pilot globally after e‑CNY.
- **Implication:** Significant growth in absolute terms but still tiny relative to India’s cash economy; not yet mainstream.

### The Rest: Minimal Public Data

- **Bahamas (Sand Dollar), Nigeria (e‑Naira):** Earlier live deployments, but no recent scaling data indicating widespread adoption. Transaction volumes remain modest relative to national cash usage.
- **Digital Euro:** Still in **preparation phase**. ECB aims to be ready for first issuance in 2029, contingent on EU legislation in 2026. Pilot exercises could start mid‑2027. No transaction volume exists yet.
- **Other advanced economies (US, UK, Japan, Canada, Australia, Singapore, HK):** Mostly research/pilot stages. No retail CBDC has announced transaction volumes comparable to e‑CNY.

### Analysis: The Scaling Chasm

Most CBDCs are stuck in pilot purgatory. Only China has crossed into mass adoption, likely due to:

- Top‑down government integration with existing payment systems.
- Strong control over financial infrastructure.
- Strategic push to internationalize the yuan (mBridge).

For others, **regulatory uncertainty**, **bank competition concerns**, and **privacy backlash** (EU opt‑out rates) are slowing momentum.

## 2. Stablecoin Regulatory Arbitrage: Compliance, Cross‑Border, and Bank Partnerships

### Regulatory Landscape 2025–2026

- **U.S. GENIUS Act (July 2025):** First comprehensive federal framework for dollar‑backed stablecoins.
  - Requires issuers to register as Permitted Payment Stablecoin Issuers (PPSI).
  - 1:1 backing with high‑quality assets (cash, Treasuries, insured deposits).
  - Segregated and audited reserves.
  - Ban on interest‑bearing stablecoins.
  - Applications deemed approved if regulators fail to act within 120 days.

- **EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto‑Assets):** Goes live July 2026.
  - Mandates 1:1 liquid reserves and 1‑day redemption rights.
  - Tightens transparency and governance standards.

- **Basel Committee:** Group 1 stablecoins (like USDC) get lower risk weights; Group 2 (others) face up to 1250% risk weight, making them uneconomic for banks.

### Issuer Compliance Status

| Issuer | Market Cap | Reserve Backing | Audit Transparency | U.S. Eligibility | Notes |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| **USDC** | $32.4B (Q1 2025) | 98.9% Treasuries/cash | Monthly independent audits, full granular reporting | ✅ Compliant (Circle PPSI‑eligible) | Leading bank‑friendly stablecoin |
| **USDT** | ~$127B Treasury holdings (largest) | Quarterly attestations (limited detail) | 🚫 Not GENIUS‑Act compliant in U.S. | ❌ Excluded from U.S. banking system | Tether in talks with Big Four for full audit |
| **USA₮** (new) | Not disclosed | To be determined | To be determined | ✅ Designed to be GENIUS‑Act compliant | Tether’s bank‑issued response, but nascent |

- **USDC** is the poster child for regulatory compliance: 41 consecutive monthly attestation reports, 100% backing with Treasuries/cash, and a planned public listing in 2025.

- **Tether** still holds massive Treasury stockpile ($127B) but lags on audit standards. The U.S. market is effectively closed to USDT; banks won’t touch it under Basel rules.

### Cross‑Border Volume

- **USDC** alone accounts for **12% of all stablecoin trading volume** in cross‑border swaps (2025).
- This reflects its growing use in international payments and remittances (e.g., Venezuelan freelancer example).
- 24‑hour velocity at 14.1% suggests active circulation.
- Average daily trading volume: $4.9B in Q1 2025 (up from $3.6B Q1 2024).

### Bank–Stablecoin Partnerships

- **JPM Coin:** JPMorgan’s institutional stablecoin for wholesale payments. Still early; not public‑facing.
- **Other banks:** U.S. banks are cautious due to regulatory uncertainty but increasingly exploring stablecoin services under the GENIUS Act framework.
- **Fintech ecosystem:** ~80% of North American fintech apps supporting stablecoin payments include USDC.
- **DeFi integration:** Over 58% of USDC trading is algorithmic/bot‑driven on DEXs (Uniswap, Curve), with 34%+ of DEX liquidity pools using USDC.

### RWA Tokenization

- Real‑world asset tokenization (treasuries, real estate) is accelerating, driven by stablecoin rails. Circle plans a public listing to fuel growth.
- However, bank‑stablecoin integration remains limited; most activity is in DeFi and fintech.

### Analysis: The Compliance Moat

**Transparency is becoming a competitive advantage.** USDC is winning bank partnerships and institutional trust due to monthly audits and U.S. regulatory alignment. Tether’s dominance is eroding in regulated markets.

MiCA will force all issuers to upgrade by mid‑2026, potentially narrowing the gap, but GENIUS‑Act compliance will still segregate the U.S. market.

## 3. Velocity vs Scale: CBDCs vs Stablecoins

- **CBDC velocity** (e‑CNY average ~$60/tx) is low, suggesting mostly consumer payments, not wholesale.
- **Stablecoin velocity** (USDC 14.1%) is much higher, indicating active trading and remittance use.

In terms of **total value transacted**:
- e‑CNY: $2T annualized (≈$5.5B/day)
- USDC: $4.9B/day trading + cross‑border

These are now in the same order of magnitude. Stablecoins are matching e‑CNY daily volume despite having no central bank backing, purely through market adoption.

## 4. Implications for Financial Infrastructure

1. **CBDCs are not the immediate disruption** many predicted. Only China has achieved meaningful scale; others are years away.
2. **Stablecoins are the real‑time incumbent** reshaping cross‑border payments and DeFi, with compliance now a key differentiator.
3. **Bank‑stablecoin partnerships** will accelerate post‑GENIUS and MiCA, potentially bridging TradFi and DeFi.
4. **Monitor digital euro timeline:** mid‑2027 pilot → 2029 issuance. This is a long runway; market may mature before launch.
5. **Geopolitical risk:** e‑CNY’s cross‑border mBridge could pressure other CBDCs to accelerate, but also raises capital‑control concerns.

---

## 5. Recommended Follow‑Ups (Next 🔴/🟡 Gaps)

- **CBDC Interoperability (mBridge progress):** How much of e‑CNY’s volume is cross‑border? Need specific mBridge transaction figures.
- **Bank profitability impact from CBDCs:** Deposit disintermediation risk estimates from major banks (earnings calls).
- **DeFi RWA tokenization TVL growth:** Track protocols like Ondo, Maple Finance; see if stablecoin integration accelerates in 2025–2026.
- **Stablecoin usage in remittances:** FXC Intelligence data shows stablecoins capturing X‑border remittance market share vs traditional rails.
