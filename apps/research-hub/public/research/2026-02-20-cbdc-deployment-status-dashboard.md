# CBDC Deployment Status Dashboard — 2026 Reality Check

**Generated:** 2026-02-20 | **Priority:** 🔴 HIGH | **Status:** Preliminary  
**Sources:** Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker (July 2025), BIS, public central bank releases  
**Abstract:** 137 countries (98% of global GDP) are exploring CBDCs; 49 pilots are active; only 3 countries have fully launched retail CBDCs (Bahamas, Jamaica, Nigeria). Major economies (US, EU, UK, Japan) remain in pilot or development phase. Live transaction volumes are scarce; e‑CNY leads in usage but still a fraction of M0. Interoperability (mBridge) progressing but not yet at scale.

---

## Executive Summary

Central Bank Digital Currencies have moved from exploration to **advanced pilots**, but **mass retail adoption** remains limited. The **digital euro** and **e‑CNY** are the most advanced G20 pilots, with the ECB targeting 2026–2027 for potential issuance. Transaction volumes in live retail CBDCs are modest (often <10% of cash circulation), but **cross‑border bridges** (Project mBridge) show promise for wholesale use cases. Regulatory frameworks (EU MiCA, US Stablecoin Act) are shaping the broader digital money ecosystem, with stablecoins capturing the **near‑term volume surge** ($27.6T onchain volume in 2024 vs CBDC retail <<<1T). CBDCs are unlikely to displace cash or stablecoins at scale before 2028, but **mandates for interoperability** could unlock network effects thereafter.

## 2. Major Pilots & Their Traction

### 2.1. China — e‑CNY (retail + wholesale)

- **Status:** Most mature major‑economy pilot; >$250 B in transactions (cumulative) through 2024, but still <0.2% of M0.
- **Usage patterns:** Primarily **government payments** (stimulus, subsidies) and **interbank settlement**; retail wallet adoption driven by red envelope campaigns.
- **Next steps:** Expansion to cross‑border via mBridge; 2025–2026 focus on **programmable money** for supply chain finance.
- **Constraint:** Privacy concerns limit voluntary adoption; transactions require linked bank accounts.

### 2.2. Eurozone — Digital Euro (retail)

- **Status:** Investigation phase complete (2023); preparation phase (2024–2025); **potential issuance decision 2025**, rollout 2026–2027 if approved.
- **Design:** Two‑tier architecture; ECBs issue digital euros; private banks distribute via wallets/apps.
- **Limits:** Holding cap likely €3,000 per person to avoid bank disintermediation.
- **Interoperability:** Seamless with SEPA; exploring cross‑border with EEA and mBridge.

### 2.3. United States — Wholesale + Research

- **Status:** No retail CBDC; Fed focusing on **wholesale settlement** (Project Hamilton, Tier 2). Congressional legislation proposed but stalled.
- **Private-sector alternative:** **FEDNow** instant payments (2023) competes with CBDC use case.
- **Outlook:** Retail CBDC unlikely before 2028; political headwinds high.

### 2.4. United Kingdom — Digital Pound (Brit  Pound)

- **Status:** Consultation phase (2023–2024); legislative timeline 2025–2026; potential launch **late 2020s**.
- **Design:** Similar to digital euro; cap £10,000 holding.

### 2.5. India — Digital Rupee (e‑₹)

- **Status:** Pilot expanded to 20+ cities (2023–2024); both **retail** and **wholesale** tracks.
- **Adoption:** Government targets ₹10 Lakh crore ($120 B) in daily volume by March 2026 (ambitious).
- **Constraint:** Low public awareness; limited merchant acceptance beyond government payments.

### 2.6. Brazil — Drex

- **Status:** Pilot launched 2024; retail rollout planned 2025–2026.
- **Focus:** Financial inclusion; interoperability with Pix instant payment system.

---

## 3. Cross‑Border Interoperability — Project mBridge

- **Participants:** Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Bank of Thailand, UAE Central Bank, Digital Currency Research Institute of the PBOC, BIS Innovation Hub.
- **Status:** Minimum Viable Product achieved 2024; **20+ participating banks** across Asia, Middle East.
- **Capabilities:** Multi‑currency atomic settlement, smart contracts for trade finance.
- **Timeline:** Potential production deployment **2026–2027**.
- **Significance:** First **real alternative to SWIFT** for CBDC‑enabled cross‑border payments; could reduce cost from 6% → <1% (similar to stablecoin advantage).

## 4. Transaction Volumes — What Do We Know?

| CBDC | Nature | Available Volume Data |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| e‑CNY | retail + wholesale | Cumulative >$250 B (2024); ~<0.2% of M0; daily active users not disclosed |
| Sand Dollar (Bahamas) | retail | <1% of national currency in circulation; usage concentrated on 3 islands |
| JAM‑DEX (Jamaica) | retail | ~10% of JMD circulation claimed; adoption driven by government payroll |
| e‑Naira (Nigeria) | retail | Volumes negligible after initial surge; <1% of NGN cash in circulation |
| Digital Euro (pilot) | not launched yet | No live volumes; test transactions <€10 M in sandbox |

**Data gap:** Central banks treat CBDC metrics as **proprietary or sensitive**; few release **real-time dashboards**. Most volume claims are **unaudited** and exclude **wholesale** transfers (which are larger).

---

## 5. Regulatory Frameworks Emerging

### 5.1. EU — MiCA (Markets in Crypto‑Assets)

- **Effective:** July 2024 (phased through 2026).
- **Impact on CBDCs:** Distinguishes **EMI‑issued tokens** (stablecoins) from **central bank digital money**; reserve requirements for stablecoins (60% in EU‑bank deposits, 40% in high‑quality assets).
- **Digital euro:** Will have separate legal basis; not subject to MiCA (central bank money).

### 5.2. US — Stablecoin Act (2024)

- **Fed jurisdiction:** Payment‑stablecoins ($>10 B) federally regulated; deposit‑taking requires banking charter.
- **Impact:** Creates **safe harbor** for compliant stablecoins (USDC, etc.); potentially **crowds out** non‑bank CBDC retail ambitions.
- **US CBDC:** Requires congressional authorization; unlikely before 2028.

### 5.3. UK — Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) sandbox

- Testing **tokenized settlement** with Bank of England; parallels digital pound research.

## 6. Stablecoins vs CBDCs — Volume Divergence

| Metric | Stablecoins (2024) | CBDCs (retail) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| On‑chain volume | $27.6 T annual | <<$1 T estimated cumulative |
| Market cap | $300 B (Jan 2026) | N/A (non‑tradable) |
| Fee/interest cost | Variable; often <0.1% | Free (central bank) but limited hold caps |
| Cross‑border | Permissive (no KYC at protocol) | KYC/AML heavy; restricted corridors |
| Adoption curve | Rapid (DeFi, remittances, speculation) | Slow (government payroll, subsidies) |

**Interpretation:** Stablecoins have captured **near‑term demand** for digital dollars; CBDCs are still in **proof‑of‑concept**. Even if digital euro launches 2027, stablecoin network effects may be **entrenched**.

---

## 7. Implications for Finance & Banking

1. **Deposit disintermediation risk** is **material** only if CBDCs offer **significant yields** or **no holding caps**. Current designs ( caps €3k, ₹10 k) limit bank flight risk.
2. **Cross‑border payments:** mBridge and stablecoins both promise <1% cost; banks must **route through these networks** or lose market share.
3. **Monetary policy transmission:** CBDCs give central banks **direct liability** to public, potentially enabling **programmable money** (helicopter drops, expiry dates). Political feasibility uncertain.
4. **Privacy:** CBDCs inherently **non‑anonymous**; cash remains privacy fallback; hybrid models (cash‑like tokens) unlikely to scale.

---

## 8. Outlook 2026–2028

| Year | Expected Milestone |
|------|-------------------|
| **2026** | Digital euro **issuance decision**; mBridge production beta; India's e‑₹ targets daily volume ₹10 Lakh crore |
| **2027** | Digital euro launch (if approved); UK digital pound pilot; China expands e‑CNY cross‑border with Belt‑and‑Road partners |
| **2028** | First major‑economy **retail CBDC in general circulation** (likely euro or yuan); interoperability standards (ISO 20022‐style) for CBDC messaging |

Key risk: **Stablecoin regulation** (US, EU) could either **co‑exist** with CBDCs or **crowd them out** if stablecoins become fully regulated and integrated with traditional banking.

---

## 9. Conclusion

CBDCs are **advancing steadily but slowly**. The world is largely in pilot phase; only 3 countries have fully launched retail versions, with modest usage. **Cross‑border bridges** (mBridge) offer the most promising near‑term value proposition for banks and corporates. Meanwhile, **stablecoins** have already captured **orders of magnitude more volume** and are on track to process **$50T+ annually** by 2026, dwarfing CBDC retail activity. The **battle for digital money** will be fought on **interoperability, regulation, and network effects** — not just central bank backing.

Enterprises should:
- **Monitor mBridge progress** for cross‑border payment opportunities.
- **Maintain stablecoin capabilities** alongside CBDC readiness.
- **Engage with central banks** on design consultations to influence proportionality (holding caps, KYC flows).
- **Prepare for dual‑track** future: stablecoins for open finance, CBDCs for regulated use cases.
