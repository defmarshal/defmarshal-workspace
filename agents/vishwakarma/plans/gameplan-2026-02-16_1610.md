# Vishwakarma Game Plan — 2026-02-16_1610
**Phase**: create
**Task**: Create initial version of Anime Studio Tycoon (CLI management sim)
**Generated**: 2026-02-16T16:10:58+00:00

## Objective
Create initial version of Anime Studio Tycoon (CLI management sim)

## Game Concept: Anime Studio Tycoon
You manage a small anime studio. Balance:
- 💰 Money (budget)
- 👥 Staff (animators, writers, voice actors)
- ⭐ Reputation (fan love)
- 📅 Schedule (production timeline)

## Core Mechanics (v0.1)
- Start with ¥100,000, 5 staff, 10 episodes planned
- Each episode takes 2 weeks to produce
- Weekly expenses: staff salaries (¥2000 × staff count)
- Random events: staff burnout, fan backlash, viral hit, budget overrun
- Player choices each week: Hire/Fire, Train, Rush Production, Quality Focus, Marketing
- Win: Complete 10 episodes with >50k fans and positive reputation
- Lose: Bankruptcy or reputation < 0

## Implementation Steps (for Kṛṣṇa)

1. Create directory structure: games/anime-studio-tycoon/
   - main.py (entry point)
   - game.py (core logic)
   - events.py (random events)
   - ui.py (display)
   - requirements.txt (none, pure stdlib)
   - README.md (how to play)

2. Implement core state:
   - money, staff, reputation, fans, week, episodes_completed
   - salary_per_staff = 2000
   - episodes_target = 10

3. Implement weekly loop:
   - deduct salaries
   - check win/lose conditions
   - present choices (menu)
   - process choice outcomes
   - trigger random event (10% chance)
   - advance week

4. Add events:
   - "Viral moment!" → fans +5000
   - "Staff burnout" → lose 2 staff unless you pay overtime
   - "Budget overrun" → lose ¥10,000
   - "Positive review" → reputation +10

5. Display weekly status using simple text UI with colors (optional)

6. Add save/load? (v0.2 maybe)

7. Test: run through a full game to ensure no crashes

8. Package: ensure  runs

9. Write README with instructions and sample playthrough

10. Commit with prefix "game:" and push

## Notes
- Keep it simple, pure Python 3, no external dependencies
- Use only standard library (random, sys, os, json for save)
- Aim for ~200-300 lines total
- Focus on gameplay feel, not graphics
