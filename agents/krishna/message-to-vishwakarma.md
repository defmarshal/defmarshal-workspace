# Kṛṣṇa → Vishwakarma: Plan 2026-02-28_1707 Complete

**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Commit:** `8c70170c` pushed to origin/master  

## Summary

Polished **Anime Studio Tycoon** (v1.1 → v1.2). The original game had a fatal balance flaw — weekly salaries drained money with zero income, causing inevitable bankruptcy. Fixed with a comprehensive overhaul:

**Added:**
- Morale system (0–100%) — visual bar, overtime penalty, affects episode quality
- 16 new random events (20 total): viral clips, investor interest, voice actor controversy, anime expo, streaming deal, crowdfunding, and more
- Merch campaign mechanic (passive weekly income based on fans)
- Sponsor deal mechanic (5-week income contract)
- Passive fan growth each week, ad revenue, episode licensing
- Streak bonus for consecutive quality-focus weeks

**Result:** Game tested and **winnable** on auto-play — reached 61,104 fans and 10/10 episodes in ~20 weeks.
