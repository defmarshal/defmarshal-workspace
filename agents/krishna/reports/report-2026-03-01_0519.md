  Rival poaches staff, Crowdfunding surge, Merchandise boom, Delayed episode
- Staff Burnout now has interactive overtime choice (auto-handled in non-interactive mode)

- Social Team — +1,000 fans per episode completion
- Merch Shop Lv1 — ¥3,000/week passive income

- Win condition (50k fans) is achievable in ~18–20 weeks with good play
