## Work Done

### Problem Analysis
The original `main.py` had a critical balance flaw: weekly salary drained ¥10,000 with **zero income**, making bankruptcy inevitable by week ~10. Fans never grew beyond 1,000 and only 4 events existed.

### Changes Made

#### `games/anime-studio-tycoon/main.py` — full rewrite (v1.1 → v1.2)

**New systems:**
- **Morale system** (0–100%) — tracks team health, shown as visual bar; low morale causes overtime cost penalties; affects episode quality
- **Streak bonus** — consecutive quality-focus weeks yield growing fan bonuses
- **Merch campaign** (choice 7) — one-time ¥10,000 investment, unlocks ~2% fans/week passive income
- **Sponsor deal** (choice 8) — 5-week deal, income = `rep×200 + fans×0.1`
- **Passive fan growth** — every week fans grow based on reputation × episodes aired
- **Ad revenue** — small passive weekly income based on fans × reputation
- **Episode licensing** — each episode aired increases licensing payout

**Expanded random events:** 4 → 20 (includes viral clips, investor interest, convention spotlight, anime expo, voice actor controversy, streaming deal, crowdfunding, staff wellness day, and more)

**New actions:**
- `6` Morale event — pay ¥1,500 for +20 morale and +2 rep
- `7` Merch campaign
- `8` Seek sponsor

**Balance overhaul:**
- Player can now sustain and grow beyond week 10
- Auto-AI heuristic improved to use income-generating actions
- Episode production quality varies by (reputation + morale) / 20

**UI improvements:**
- Box-drawing header and per-week status panel
- Formatted numbers (¥60,692 not ¥60692)
- Morale progress bar `[███████░░░] 70%`

#### `games/anime-studio-tycoon/README.md` — updated
- Added full gameplay table, income source breakdown, metric descriptions
- Added v1.2 changelog
