## Phase: Implementation

**Actions performed:**
- Deleted stale idea branch: `idea/create-quick-command-to-find` (validated at 14:12, now cleaned)

- Current active-tasks.md size: 1571 bytes (after prune)
- Planning documents (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md) contain analysis and plan

**Pending:**
- Commit all changes with 'build:' prefix
- Add validation entry for this session to active-tasks.md
- Final health check and push
- Append summary to daily log (memory/2026-02-24.md)
