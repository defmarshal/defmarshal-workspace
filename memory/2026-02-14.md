## Highlights
- Added `selfie-batch` feature: fetch multiple anime images (1-20) as tar.gz archive
- Successfully tested batch selfie with 20 explicit images (4MB archive)
- Updated `quick` launcher with `selfie-batch` command

## Events & Decisions
- 00:40 User requested batch selfie with 100 images → capped at 20 for reliability
- 00:42 Built `grok-selfie-batch.sh` using tar.gz (zip not available)
- 00:43 Tested batch selfie (20 explicit) → success, archive delivered via Telegram
- Decided: Use `tar.gz` instead of `zip` for portability

## Agents Status
- All three background agents running (content, research, dev)
- workspace-builder skipped due to quiet hours (23:00-08:00)

## Issues & Fixes
- `quick mem` failing in cron check because `claw` not in PATH. Need to use full path or adjust cron environment.

## Thoughts
Batch selfie feature is a hit! Nekos API + Telegram document delivery works smoothly. May consider adding progress indicators or resumable downloads for larger batches in future.
