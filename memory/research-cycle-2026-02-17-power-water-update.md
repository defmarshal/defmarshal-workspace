# Research Cycle: 2026-02-17 19:35–19:50 UTC

## Summary
Completed **critical gap update**: AI Infrastructure Power & Water Constraints. Quantitative surge in demand is creating binding physical limits that directly impact AI deployment timelines and ROI.

## Deliverables
- `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/research/2026-02-17-ai-infrastructure-power-water-update.md` (11 KB)
  - Virginia: >5 GW current, 70% load growth by 2045, 3–5 yr interconnection delays
  - U.S. queues: >2,000 GW (more than existing fleet)
  - Nuclear/SMR deals: Microsoft 835MW, Google 500MW, Amazon $20B+ ($50B+ aggregate)
  - Water: medium hyperscale 110M gal/yr; WUE improvements (0.1–0.3 L/kWh) vs absolute rise
  - Policy: Ireland (>20% national electricity), Singapore moratorium, EU reporting
- Updated `research/INDEX.md`

## Metadata
- Gap: #4A (Power & Water Constraints — quantitative update)
- Tools: web_search (3), web_fetch (1), read (2), write (1), edit (1), exec (1)
- Model: openrouter/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free
