**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 73% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+, reindex 4.0 days old
- Git: clean, 3 untracked files present
- Updates: none pending
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7GB
- active-tasks.md: 1292 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 29 lines

**Observations:**
- Two valuable untracked files detected:
  1. `research/2026-02-28-enterprise-planning-analytics-market-competitive-analysis.md` — substantive EPM market analysis report (38KB)
  2. `scripts/meta-supervisor-restart.sh` — utility script for daemon management (1KB)
- Quick launcher already provides `meta-restart` command, which uses internal restart logic.
- Daily log started today with only morning entries; this session will finalize later after other cron runs.

**Actions performed:**
1. Staged untracked artifacts for tracking: `research/2026-02-28-enterprise-planning-analytics-market-competitive-analysis.md` and `scripts/meta-supervisor-restart.sh`.
2. Created planning documentation: task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md.
3. Ran validation: all constraints satisfied ✅ (active-tasks 1292b <2KB, MEM29, health green, reindex 4d fresh, no temp files, APT none).
4. Committed staged files:
   - `build: track research report (EPM market analysis) and meta-supervisor restart script`
5. Updated active-tasks.md: added running entry `[workspace-builder-23dad379]` for current session.
6. Pushed commit to origin.
7. Will continue monitoring; final validation and close the loop after day's cron cycles complete.

**Validation:**
- `./quick validate-constraints`: ✅ All 7 constraints satisfied.
- `git status`: staged 2 new files; no modified tracked files.
- No temp files, no stale branches.

**Next steps:** Later today, after additional agent runs, ensure daily log is complete, final validation, mark session validated in active-tasks, prune if needed, commit and push.

**Outcome:** Workspace maintained, valuable artifacts tracked, constraints green. Session in progress.
