# 2026-02-27 — Daily Log

## Notifier-Triggered Maintenance (06:19 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `notifier-cron` execution

**Observation:**
- Git working tree dirty: `apps/research-hub/INDEX.md` timestamp stale (05:05 → 06:05)
- Notifier-agent log contained a historical error pattern (unrelated to current execution)

**Actions taken:**
1. Committed and pushed index timestamp update:
   - `build: update research-hub index timestamp (notifier-triggered cleanup 2026-02-27)`
2. Verified git clean, constraints satisfied
3. Notifier-agent syntax validated (no issues found); error in log appears to be legacy

**Status:** Workspace returned to clean state; all constraints green.

*Logged by main session in response to notifier-cron execution at 2026-02-27 06:19 UTC*

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 72% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+, reindex ~2-3 days old
- Git: dirty (1 changed: `apps/research-hub/INDEX.md`)
- Updates: none pending
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7GB
- active-tasks.md: 1720 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- Constraints: `validate-constraints` failed due to git dirty

**Analysis:**
- The only uncommitted change was a timestamp update in `apps/research-hub/INDEX.md` (last updated field refreshed)
- active-tasks.md contained a validated workspace-builder entry under "Running" section (should be moved to Completed for clarity)
- File size approaching 2KB limit; need to monitor after adding new entry

**Actions performed:**
1. Committed pending change:
   - `build: update research-hub index timestamp (workspace-builder session 20260227-0109)`
   - Pushed to origin
2. Restructured active-tasks.md:
   - Moved validated entry `[workspace-builder-20260226-2300]` to Completed section
   - Added new running entry `[workspace-builder-20260227-0109]` for current session
   - Initial post-update size: 1974 bytes (<2KB)
3. Ran constraint validation: all passed except git dirty (expected due to pending docs commit)
4. Committed planning documentation (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md):
   - `build: mark workspace-builder session validated (2026-02-27 01:09 UTC)`
   - Pushed
5. Updated active-tasks entry to validated with verification metrics
6. Pruned oldest completed entry `[workspace-builder-23dad379]` to keep active-tasks.md under 2KB (size after prune: 1719 bytes)
7. Final validation: all constraints satisfied; git clean; remote synchronized

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: Disk 72%, Updates none, Git clean, Memory clean, Gateway healthy, Downloads 17/5.7G
- `./quick validate-constraints`: ✅ All constraints satisfied (active-tasks 1719b <2KB, MEM30, health green, no temp files, APT none, reindex age fresh)
- Git: clean and up-to-date with origin
- No stale branches, no temp files

**Outcome:** Workspace fully maintained. All constraints enforced. Repository healthy.

## Workspace Builder Run (03:15 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 71% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+, reindex 3.1 days old
- Git: dirty (1 modified: `apps/research-hub/INDEX.md`; 1 untracked: `reports/2026-02-27-daily-digest.md`)
- active-tasks.md: 1698 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- Remote tracking: `origin/master`

**Observations:**
- The research hub index timestamp was updated again (04:06 → 05:05 UTC) by an automated process.
- A new daily digest report was generated in `reports/` (untracked).
- Active tasks showed the previous session already validated and moved to Completed.
- The remote has two branches: `origin/main` and `origin/master`. Local tracks `origin/master`.
- Initial push attempt to `origin/main` failed due to non-fast-forward (branch divergence).

**Actions performed:**
1. Staged and committed pending changes:
   - `build: commit workspace-builder pending changes (INDEX timestamp, daily digest report)`
2. Pushed to correct remote tracking branch: `git push origin master` (fast-forward succeeded).
3. Verified all constraints: health green, active-tasks 1698b, MEM30, no temp files, git clean.
4. Updated active-tasks.md:
   - Moved current entry `[workspace-builder-23dad379]` from Running to Completed.
   - Corrected verification metrics (size 1698b, git clean & pushed).
5. Committed active-tasks.md reorganization:
   - `build: mark workspace-builder session validated, reorganize active-tasks (move to Completed, prune size)`
6. Pushed final update to origin.

**Validation:**
- `./quick validate-constraints`: ✅ All constraints satisfied.
- `git status`: clean, up-to-date with `origin/master`.
- No temp files, no stale branches.

**Outcome:** Workspace clean, all documentation updated, remote synchronized. Session closed successfully.
