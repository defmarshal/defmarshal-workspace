- Agent Manager stopped cleanly

**Outcome:** System health confirmed. All cron schedules synchronized with documentation. No cleanup actions required.

## Workspace Builder Run (01:09 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 72% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+, reindex ~2-3 days old
- Git: dirty (1 changed: `apps/research-hub/INDEX.md`)
- Updates: none pending
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7GB
- active-tasks.md: 1720 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- Constraints: `validate-constraints` failed due to git dirty

**Analysis:**
- The only uncommitted change was a timestamp update in `apps/research-hub/INDEX.md` (last updated field refreshed)
- active-tasks.md contained a validated workspace-builder entry under "Running" section (should be moved to Completed for clarity)
- File size approaching 2KB limit; need to monitor after adding new entry

**Actions performed:**
1. Committed pending change:
   - `build: update research-hub index timestamp (workspace-builder session 20260227-0109)`
   - Pushed to origin
2. Restructured active-tasks.md:
   - Moved validated entry `[workspace-builder-20260226-2300]` to Completed section
   - Added new running entry `[workspace-builder-20260227-0109]` for current session
   - Initial post-update size: 1974 bytes (<2KB)
3. Ran constraint validation: all passed except git dirty (expected due to pending docs commit)
4. Committed planning documentation (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md):
   - `build: mark workspace-builder session validated (2026-02-27 01:09 UTC)`
   - Pushed
5. Updated active-tasks entry to validated with verification metrics
6. Pruned oldest completed entry `[workspace-builder-23dad379]` to keep active-tasks.md under 2KB (size after prune: 1719 bytes)
7. Final validation: all constraints satisfied; git clean; remote synchronized

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: Disk 72%, Updates none, Git clean, Memory clean, Gateway healthy, Downloads 17/5.7G
- `./quick validate-constraints`: ✅ All constraints satisfied (active-tasks 1719b <2KB, MEM30, health green, no temp files, APT none, reindex age fresh)
- Git: clean and up-to-date with origin
- No stale branches, no temp files

**Outcome:** Workspace fully maintained. All constraints enforced. Repository healthy.
