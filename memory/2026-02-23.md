# 2026-02-23 — Daily Log

## Notifier Agent Execution (00:07 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `notifier-cron` (bf81aee0-e4ab-4823-879a-3001eb1341de) executed at 00:07 AM UTC.

**Inspected:**
- Active tasks registry: all agents validated/cleaned, no running agents
- Previous day's log (2026-02-22): All systems green; workspace builder completed successfully
- Notifier agent log: historical error line from 2026-02-19 present but subsequent runs all OK
- CRON_JOBS.md: notifier-cron documented (every 2h UTC)
- Script `agents/notifier-agent.sh`: function syntax correct; manual run succeeded
- Cron job state: lastStatus "ok", lastDuration 43s

**Status:** Normal operation. The notifier agent monitors:
- Cron job failures (>2 consecutive errors)
- Disk usage threshold (>=85%)
- Gateway status

All metrics currently healthy. No alerts sent.

**Note:** The notifier-agent.log begins with an old error line (`./agents/notifier-agent.sh: line 6: log: command not found`) from early February; subsequent entries are all successful. This is a historical artifact; current runs work correctly.

*Auto-logged from cron execution*
