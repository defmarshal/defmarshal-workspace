# 2026-02-26 — Daily Log

## Workspace Builder Run (01:08 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 70% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+ (Voyage rate-limited), reindexed 2.0d ago
- Git: clean but ahead by 2 commits (content + dev work)
- Updates: none pending
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7GB
- active-tasks.md: 1903 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 31 lines (target ≤30)

**Analysis:**
- Two commits awaiting publish (content daily digest, dev-agent log fix)
- MEMORY.md 1 line over limit
- active-tasks.md size safe but need to add session entry
- No other issues

**Actions performed:**
1. Pushed pending commits to origin (2 commits: content + dev)
2. Trimmed MEMORY.md to 30 lines (removed oldest learning entry: 2026-02-20)
3. Created planning documentation: task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md
4. Added running entry to active-tasks.md (session key: workspace-builder-20260226-0108)
5. Completed session: updated active-tasks entry to validated, added verification metrics
6. Pruned oldest completed entry (workspace-builder-20260225-1700) to maintain <2KB
7. Validated all constraints: health green, active-tasks 1866b (<2KB), MEMORY.md 30 lines, git clean
8. Committed changes: `7d0b2a59 build: enforce constraints - push pending commits, trim MEMORY to 30 lines, update active-tasks, add planning docs (session 20260226-0108)`
9. Pushed commit to origin

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: All green
- `./quick validate-constraints`: ✅ All constraints satisfied
- active-tasks.md: 1866 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- Git: clean and up-to-date
- No stale branches, no temp files

**Outcome:** Workspace fully maintained. Constraints enforced. All changes documented and pushed.
