# 2026-02-26 — Daily Log

## Workspace Builder Run (01:08 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 70% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+ (Voyage rate-limited), reindexed 2.0d ago
- Git: clean but ahead by 2 commits (content + dev work)
- Updates: none pending
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7GB
- active-tasks.md: 1903 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 31 lines (target ≤30)

**Analysis:**
- Two commits awaiting publish (content daily digest, dev-agent log fix)
- MEMORY.md 1 line over limit
- active-tasks.md size safe but need to add session entry
- No other issues

**Actions performed:**
1. Pushed pending commits to origin (2 commits: content + dev)
2. Trimmed MEMORY.md to 30 lines (removed oldest learning entry: 2026-02-20)
3. Created planning documentation: task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md
4. Added running entry to active-tasks.md (session key: workspace-builder-20260226-0108)
5. Completed session: updated active-tasks entry to validated, added verification metrics
6. Pruned oldest completed entry (workspace-builder-20260225-1700) to maintain <2KB
7. Validated all constraints: health green, active-tasks 1866b (<2KB), MEMORY.md 30 lines, git clean
8. Committed changes: `7d0b2a59 build: enforce constraints - push pending commits, trim MEMORY to 30 lines, update active-tasks, add planning docs (session 20260226-0108)`
9. Pushed commit to origin

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: All green
- `./quick validate-constraints`: ✅ All constraints satisfied
- active-tasks.md: 1866 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- Git: clean and up-to-date
- No stale branches, no temp files

**Outcome:** Workspace fully maintained. Constraints enforced. All changes documented and pushed.

## Meta-Agent Run (02:06 UTC) - Forced Research Cycle

**Trigger:** Cron job `meta-agent-cron` (scheduled every 6 hours)

**System snapshot:**
- Disk: 70%
- Content produced today: 5 items
- Research produced today: 0 items (below threshold of 5)

**Observation:**
Research output for 2026-02-26 was insufficient (0 reports). Meta-agent initiated a forced research cycle to catch up.

**Action taken:**
Spawned research-agent with topic: **"AI Agent Frameworks 2026 — Comparison & Trends"**

**Result:**
Research-agent completed successfully, producing comprehensive analysis covering:
- OpenAI Swarm, AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph comparison
- Benchmark table with 6 criteria
- Decision matrix and implementation guidance
- Report file: `research/2026-02-26-ai-agent-frameworks-2026-comparison.md` (13 KB)
- TTS audio generated: `research/2026-02-26-ai-agent-frameworks-2026-comparison.mp3` (197 KB)

**Commit:** `e492694d research: AI Agent Frameworks 2026 — Comparison & Trends`

**Status:** Research library now at 192 reports (100% TTS target). All changes pushed.

**Notes:**
- Agent performance learning remains disabled due to Voyage AI rate limits.
- Meta-agent-state.json modified (state update).

## Supervisor Cron Run (06:08 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `supervisor-cron` (scheduled every 30 minutes)

**System snapshot:**
- All checks passed: cron job health, gateway status, memory reindex status, disk usage (70%), APT updates (none pending)
- No alerts triggered

**Actions performed:**
- Ran comprehensive health checks
- Verified meta-supervisor daemon is running (active-tasks.md)
- Memory index age 2.2 days (acceptable)
- Gateway healthy
- System health: green

**Outcome:** System stable. No maintenance required. All services operational.

## Workspace Builder Run (07:08 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 70% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+, reindexed 2.2d ago
- Git: clean working tree, but ahead of origin by 2 commits (content daily digest, dev memory-reindex-if-stale)
- Updates: none pending
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7GB
- active-tasks.md: 1935 bytes (<2KB) -> after prune 1643 bytes
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- No stale branches, no temp files
- Validate-constraints: all green

**Analysis:**
- Two commits created by content-agent and dev-agent were not pushed
- This needed to be fixed to keep remote synchronized
- active-tasks.md needed pruning to accommodate new session entry
- All other constraints satisfied

**Actions performed:**
1. Pushed pending commits to origin:
   - `51085005 content: Update daily digest 2026-02-26`
   - `752503f8 dev: Add memory-reindex-if-stale utility — reindex only when index is stale`
   - Command: `git push origin master`
2. Pruned active-tasks.md: removed oldest completed workspace-builder entry (`workspace-builder-20260226-0108`) to maintain size <2KB
   - Final size after prune: 1643 bytes
3. Created planning documentation (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
4. After validation, added validated entry to active-tasks.md:
   - Session key: `workspace-builder-20260226-0708`
   - Verification metrics: active-tasks 1643b (<2KB), MEM30, git clean, all constraints satisfied
5. Committed changes: `aea29b98 build: push pending commits, prune active-tasks, create planning docs (session 20260226-0708); all constraints validated`
6. Pushed commit to origin

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: Disk 70%, Updates none, Git clean, Memory clean, Gateway healthy, Downloads 17/5.7G
- `./quick validate-constraints`: ✅ All constraints satisfied (active-tasks 2036b <2KB, MEM30, git clean, health green, no temp files, APT none, reindex age 2d fresh)
- Git: up-to-date with origin, working tree clean
- No temp files, no stale branches

**Outcome:** Workspace fully synchronized and validated. All constraints enforced. Planning documentation created and committed. Session completed successfully.

## Workspace Builder Run (09:10 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 70% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+, reindexed 2.2d ago
- Git: ahead of origin by 6 commits (content + dev work accumulated since last run)
- Updates: none pending
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7GB
- active-tasks.md: ~2036 bytes (near 2KB limit)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- Stale idea branch: `idea/create-an-agent-that-autonomously` (60m old)

**Analysis:**
- Content and dev agents produced 6 commits awaiting push
- active-tasks.md would exceed 2KB after adding session entry; requires pruning
- One stale idea branch needs cleanup
- Otherwise system healthy

**Actions performed:**
1. Pushed 6 pending commits to origin:
   - content: Update daily digest (2 versions)
   - content: LinkedIn PA technical-performance analyst-report (0716)
   - content: LinkedIn PA comparative-analysis analyst-report (0812)
   - dev: Fix LinkedIn PA agent timestamp arithmetic
   - dev: Add heartbeat-state command
2. Deleted stale idea branch `idea/create-an-agent-that-autonomously` (local only)
3. Pruned active-tasks.md:
   - Removed oldest completed workspace-builder entry (`workspace-builder-20260226-0305`)
   - Initial size ~2036b → post-prune ~1688b
4. Created planning documentation (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
5. Added validated entry to active-tasks.md:
   - Session key: `workspace-builder-20260226-0910`
   - Verification: active-tasks 1688b (<2KB), MEM30, health green, no temp files, all constraints satisfied
6. Committed changes:
   - `5af1f57d build: enforce constraints - push commits, cleanup branches, update active-tasks, document session (20260226-0910)`
7. Pushed commit to origin

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: Disk 70%, Updates none, Git clean (after commit), Memory clean, Gateway healthy, Downloads 17/5.7G
- `./quick validate-constraints`: ✅ All constraints satisfied (active-tasks 1656b, MEM30, git clean, health green, no temp files, APT none, reindex age fresh)
- Git: up-to-date, working tree clean
- active-tasks.md final: 1656 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines

## Workspace Builder Run (13:09 UTC)

6. Pushed commit to origin
7. Final validation: all constraints green; git clean; repository synchronized

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: Disk 71%, Updates none, Git clean, Memory clean, Gateway healthy, Downloads 17/5.7G
