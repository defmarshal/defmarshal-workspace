## Morning Session
- User resumed conversation after ~1 day gap.
- Discussed memory system upgrade; added Voyage AI API key (pa-SaFqGrt...).
- Gateway restarted to load credentials.

## Investigation
- Memory indexing initially hung due to Voyage batch mode issues.
- Discovered Voyage free tier without payment method limited to 3 RPM and 10K TPM.
- Attempted indexing; batch requests caused rate limits (429 errors).
- Tried disabling batch via config (`agents.defaults.memorySearch.remote.batch.enabled=false`) and restarting.
- Indexing completed successfully after batching disabled.
- Semantic search triggered embedding queries; still hit rate limits during normal usage.
- Tried disabling vectors (`agents.defaults.memorySearch.store.vector.enabled=false`) but index still used embeddings until rebuilt; rate limits persisted.

## Decision: Simple Text Search
- User chose to avoid rate limits and use a plain-text search implementation.
- Created `msearch` script in workspace:
  - Uses `rg` if available, else `grep`.
  - Searches `MEMORY.md` and `memory/*.md`.
  - Outputs `file:line:content`.
  - Fast, offline, no API limits.

## Memory Maintenance Policy
- User instructed: "Write in your memory, notes everything we've done whether i told you to memorize it or not."
- I will now proactively log significant actions, decisions, and events into memory files.

## Updates to MEMORY.md
- Refreshed `MEMORY.md` with current status (Voyage configured but rate-limited; simple text search in use).
- Added this daily entry.

## Git Setup
- Created private GitHub repo: `defmarshal/defmarshal-workspace`
- Configured git user.name and user.email
- Initialized git in workspace
- Committed all files (53 files, initial commit)
- Set up credential helper (`git config --global credential.helper store`) and stored PAT securely in `~/.git-credentials` (600)
- Pushed to GitHub successfully (remote URL clean, no PAT embedded)
- Verified push works: `git push` now uses stored credentials
- **Note for future:** Use the same repo (`defmarshal/defmarshal-workspace`) as the default workspace repository.

## Proactive Build (Night Session)
- User directive: "be proactive... create something for me... etch into soul.md and memory"
- Decided to build: Workspace Dashboard (CLI)
- Features: Bangkok time/weather, next Indonesian holiday, git status, recent commits, memory search
- Implemented in Python (`dashboard.py`) with shell wrapper (`dashboard.sh`)
- Tested locally, then committed and pushed to GitHub
- Updated MEMORY.md with "GitHub private repos" note and default repo
- Recorded the initiative in today's entry
- Enhancement: Added system health (disk usage, upgradable packages) and days-until for holidays; tested and pushed
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md to include autonomous proactive checks during night hours (22:00–06:00 UTC+7)
