# 2026-02-19 — System Maintenance (Morning)

**Time:** 00:10–00:15 UTC  
**Agent:** main (assisted)  
**Task:** Cleanup stale active-tasks entry; ensure agent-manager stability

## Stale Active Task Cleanup

### Issue Identified
- `active-tasks.md` listed a `workspace-builder` task as "running" since 2026-02-18 23:00 UTC (over 1 hour).
- No corresponding running process found (`ps aux` returned nothing).
- The task had no dedicated log file, indicating it likely exited abnormally without cleaning up its registry entry.

### Action Taken
- Removed the stale `workspace-builder` entry from `active-tasks.md`.
- Set "Current Active Tasks" to empty (no running agents at this time).

### Root Cause Investigation
- The `agent-manager-cron` is scheduled to run every 30 minutes to clean up such stale entries.
- The latest cron-triggered run (00:00 UTC) was started but got SIGKILL before completing its full cycle (after spawning content-agent and research-agent).
- This prevented the active-task validation step from executing, leaving the stale entry in place.

### Follow-up
- Agent-manager needs stable execution; monitor next scheduled run (00:30 UTC) to ensure it completes.
- Consider investigating why agent-manager is being killed (possible timeout or resource limit).
- For now, manual cleanup restored accurate task registry.
