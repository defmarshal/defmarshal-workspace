[2026-02-13 22:00 UTC+7] Workspace Builder run: Completed polish automation.
- Added email-cleaner cron job: daily 09:00 Asia/Bangkok.
- Created CRON_JOBS.md documenting all scheduled tasks.
- Updated .gitignore to ignore installed skill directories (neural-memory, openclaw-memory, planning-with-files).
- Updated MEMORY.md to reflect email-cleaner automation.
- Committed and pushed pending upgrades: quick launcher now uses `claw memory`, log-event now uses openclaw-memory.
All changes committed (build: ...). No issues.
