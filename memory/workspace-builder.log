[2026-02-13 11:00 UTC] Workspace-Builder run: Building Anime Companion

OBJECTIVE: Integrate installed anime-lookup and edge-tts skills into a unified CLI tool.

ACTIONS:
- Created `anime-companion` Python CLI (executable):
  * Implements search, info, top, season, upcoming commands using Jikan API
  * Integrates edge-tts for optional MP3 narration (--tts flag)
  * Outputs formatted anime details; TTS saves to tts_output/
- Updated `quick` launcher to include `anime` command
- Installed edge-tts Node.js dependencies (`npm install` in skills/edge-tts/scripts)
- Added `ANIME_COMPANION_README.md` documentation
- Updated MEMORY.md Tools & Skills section
- Created `.gitignore` to exclude node_modules and tts_output

TESTING:
- `quick anime top 3` → displayed top anime list ✓
- `quick anime info 52991` → displayed Frieren full info ✓
- `quick anime info 52991 --tts` → generated MP3 narration ✓
- `quick anime season 2025 spring` → displayed season anime ✓
- `quick anime search "naruto" --tts` → displayed search results + TTS ✓

FILES ADDED/MODIFIED:
+ anime-companion
+ ANIME_COMPANION_README.md
+ .gitignore
+ memory/workspace-builder.log (this file)
M quick
M MEMORY.md
(plus edge-tts node_modules installed, not tracked)

NEXT STEPS:
- Commit with prefix 'build:' and push to GitHub
- Consider adding caching for TTS to avoid regeneration
- Possibly integrate with Telegram for sending audio directly

[2026-02-13 13:00 UTC] Workspace-Builder run: Daily Memory Automation

OBJECTIVE: Automate daily memory capture and summarization to reduce manual overhead and ensure consistent archival.

ACTIONS:
- Created `log-event` script: quick command to log categorized events (decision, learning, event, note) to today's memory file with bold category markers.
- Created `summarize-day` Python script: reads daily memory, extracts bullet points, categorizes via keyword heuristics, generates a markdown summary with sections (Decisions, Learnings, Tools, Projects, Events, Other). Appends summary to daily file.
- Updated `quick` launcher to support `log` and `summarize` commands.
- Installed daily cron job (22:30 Asia/Bangkok) to run `summarize-day` automatically; logs to memory/daily-summary-cron.log.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude cron logs (`memory/*.log`).
- Updated `MEMORY.md`:
   * Marked Memory System Overhaul summarization task as completed.
   * Added Memory Automation tools to Tools & Skills.
   * Added milestone to Important Dates & Events (2026-02-13).
- Appended first automatic summary to memory/2026-02-13.md.

TESTING:
- `quick log decision "Test logging"` → appended to today's memory ✓
- `quick summarize 2026-02-13` → generated categorized summary with 34 entries, appended to file ✓
- Verified cron entry added: `30 22 * * * TZ='Asia/Bangkok' /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/summarize-day >> /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/memory/daily-summary-cron.log 2>&1`

FILES ADDED/MODIFIED:
+ log-event
+ summarize-day
M quick
M .gitignore
M MEMORY.md
M memory/2026-02-13.md
(plus .clawhub/lock.json updated from prior skill ops; committed as part of current state)

NEXT STEPS:
- Consider refining categorization keywords for better accuracy
- Optionally add summary to MEMORY.md via automated merge (review before commit)
- Monitor daily cron execution; adjust time if needed
