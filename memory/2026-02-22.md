**Commits:**
- `5b420d4b` build: workspace hygiene - ignore mp3, add tts-random utility, prune active-tasks, update planning docs

## Polyglot TTS Deployment (04:55–05:07 UTC)

**Architecture finalized:**
- English reports → Kokoro `af_heart` (offline, ~200 KB each)
- Japanese reports → Edge TTS `ja-JP-NanamiNeural` (online, ~20 KB, rate +18%, pitch +12%)

**Integration:**
- `scripts/tts-research.sh` auto‑detects Japanese via Unicode check
- Integrated into `agents/research-cycle.sh` for automatic generation
- Sample generation: 175/181 research reports now have MP3 companions

**Voice verification:**
- Confirmed `jf_nezumi` and `jf_alpha` exist in Kokoro model but not published → kept Edge TTS for Japanese (flawless, no downloads)
- Edge TTS reliable; 700‑char safe limit enforced

**CLI enhancements:**
- Added `quick tts-stats` (new `scripts/tts-stats.sh`) for coverage breakdown by language
- Current coverage: 96.7% (175/181) – remaining 6 are non‑content files (INDEX, task_plan, etc.)

**Commit pushed:** `cbd805e2` dev: Add tts-stats command

**System health:** stable; gateway up; memory local; no pending updates; disk 64%

## Workspace Builder Run (07:00 UTC continuation)

**Context:** Follow-up to 05:00 UTC run. Detected uncommitted agent artifacts that needed finalization.

**Actions performed:**
- Staged and committed `content/2026-02-22-infrastructure-digest.md` (daily digest from content-agent)
- Staged and committed `memory/evolver-summary.md` (appended with evolver cycle from 06:11 UTC)
- Updated planning files (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md) to reflect current work
- Ran close-the-loop verification (health OK, git clean, no temp files)
- Pushed commits to origin

**Commits:**
- `2318e7e7` build: preserve agent outputs - commit evolver-summary and infrastructure digest
- `3e4e612f` build: update planning docs for current session and close the loop
- `e6cc7a34` build: correct progress.md - no active-tasks entry needed for main cron session

**Validation:** All OK; git clean; no temp files; active-tasks.md healthy (33 lines).

## Workspace Builder Run (09:00 UTC)

**Context:** Repository hygiene check identified a stale feature branch.

**Issue:** Branch `idea/automate-memory-stores-cleanup-using` was created by idea executor but never completed. It contained only a revert of the `git-sync` utility, which is actually valuable and present on `master`. The branch was orphaned and should be removed.

**Actions performed:**
- Checked current branch: was on `idea/automate-memory-stores-cleanup-using`.
- Switched to `master` branch.
- Deleted local stale branch: `git branch -D idea/automate-memory-stores-cleanup-using`.
- Verified no remote branch exists (`origin` does not have `idea/automate-memory-stores-cleanup-using`).
- Verified branch removal: `git branch -a` shows no references.
- Updated this daily log (memory/2026-02-22.md) with this entry.
- Committed and pushed changes (planning files + daily log update).

**Commits:**
- `b6b5212d` build: workspace hygiene cleanup - delete stale idea branch, update planning and daily log

**Validation:** health OK; git clean; no temp files; active-tasks.md unchanged (~33 lines). Git dirty state before commit was expected (planning files + log change), resolved after push.

## Workspace Builder Run (11:00 UTC continuation)

**Context:** After the 09:00 cleanup, a new stale branch appeared: `idea/design-a-fun-dashboard-to`. Additionally, untracked `skills/package.json` and related files were present.

**Issue:** 
- Stale feature branch `idea/design-a-fun-dashboard-to` was created (likely by idea executor or manual) and HEAD was left on it.
- The branch contains a single revert commit that corrects a mistaken label change in `scripts/tts-stats.sh`: restores "Japanese (Edge)" from incorrect "Japanese (Kokoro)".
- Untracked npm artifacts in `skills/` (package.json, package-lock.json, node_modules) should be removed.

**Actions performed:**
- Verified current branch: `idea/design-a-fun-dashboard-to`.
- Reviewed branch commit: 3096954e (revert of 7ae8e966) – this revert fixes the tts-stats label.
- Checked out `master`.
- Merged the feature branch with `--no-ff` to preserve history and incorporate the fix.
- Verified `scripts/tts-stats.sh` now contains `printf "Japanese (Edge): %d\n" "$japanese"`.
- Deleted local branch: `git branch -D idea/design-a-fun-dashboard-to`.
- Removed untracked files: `rm -f skills/package.json skills/package-lock.json; rm -rf skills/node_modules`.
- Confirmed no remaining references to the branch.
- Ran `quick health`: all OK (Disk 64%, Memory clean, Gateway healthy, Downloads normal). Git dirty (3 changed) – expected due to planning files and pending daily log.
- Checked for temp files: none.
- Appended this entry to daily log.
- Committed planning file updates (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md) as part of workspace builder lifecycle.
- Pushed master to origin (merge commit + daily log + planning updates).

**Commits:**
- (merge) `fix: correct tts-stats Japanese label to Edge (revert mistaken Kokoro label)`
- `build: update planning docs for current session and close the loop` (planning files)
- `build: record workspace-builder 11:00 run - merge tts-stats fix, cleanup branch, remove skills artifacts`

**Validation:** 
- Current branch: `master`
- tts-stats.sh fix verified
- Stale branch deleted locally
- Skills directory clean of npm artifacts
- Health OK; no temp files; git clean after push; active-tasks.md <2KB.
