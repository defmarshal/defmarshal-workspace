## Polyglot TTS Deployment (04:55–05:07 UTC)

**Architecture finalized:**
- English reports → Kokoro `af_heart` (offline, ~200 KB each)
- Japanese reports → Edge TTS `ja-JP-NanamiNeural` (online, ~20 KB, rate +18%, pitch +12%)

**Integration:**
- `scripts/tts-research.sh` auto‑detects Japanese via Unicode check
- Integrated into `agents/research-cycle.sh` for automatic generation
- Sample generation: 175/181 research reports now have MP3 companions

**Voice verification:**
- Confirmed `jf_nezumi` and `jf_alpha` exist in Kokoro model but not published → kept Edge TTS for Japanese (flawless, no downloads)
- Edge TTS reliable; 700‑char safe limit enforced

**CLI enhancements:**
- Added `quick tts-stats` (new `scripts/tts-stats.sh`) for coverage breakdown by language
- Current coverage: 96.7% (175/181) – remaining 6 are non‑content files (INDEX, task_plan, etc.)

**Commit pushed:** `cbd805e2` dev: Add tts-stats command

**System health:** stable; gateway up; memory local; no pending updates; disk 64%

## Workspace Builder Run (07:00 UTC continuation)

**Context:** Follow-up to 05:00 UTC run. Detected uncommitted agent artifacts that needed finalization.

- Staged and committed `memory/evolver-summary.md` (appended with evolver cycle from 06:11 UTC)
- Updated planning files (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md) to reflect current work
- Ran close-the-loop verification (health OK, git clean, no temp files)
- Pushed commits to origin

**Commits:**
- `2318e7e7` build: preserve agent outputs - commit evolver-summary and infrastructure digest
- `3e4e612f` build: update planning docs for current session and close the loop
- `e6cc7a34` build: correct progress.md - no active-tasks entry needed for main cron session

**Validation:** All OK; git clean; no temp files; active-tasks.md healthy (33 lines).
