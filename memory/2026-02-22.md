## Polyglot TTS Deployment (04:55–05:07 UTC)

**Architecture finalized:**
- English reports → Kokoro `af_heart` (offline, ~200 KB each)
- Japanese reports → Edge TTS `ja-JP-NanamiNeural` (online, ~20 KB, rate +18%, pitch +12%)

**Integration:**
- `scripts/tts-research.sh` auto‑detects Japanese via Unicode check
- Integrated into `agents/research-cycle.sh` for automatic generation
- Sample generation: 175/181 research reports now have MP3 companions

**Voice verification:**
- Confirmed `jf_nezumi` and `jf_alpha` exist in Kokoro model but not published → kept Edge TTS for Japanese (flawless, no downloads)
- Edge TTS reliable; 700‑char safe limit enforced

**CLI enhancements:**
- Added `quick tts-stats` (new `scripts/tts-stats.sh`) for coverage breakdown by language
- Current coverage: 96.7% (175/181) – remaining 6 are non‑content files (INDEX, task_plan, etc.)

**Commit pushed:** `cbd805e2` dev: Add tts-stats command

**System health:** stable; gateway up; memory local; no pending updates; disk 64%

## Full Kokoro Migration (05:41 UTC)

**Change:** Replaced Edge TTS with Kokoro for Japanese as well.
- `scripts/tts-research.sh` now routes both English and Japanese to Kokoro.
- `scripts/kokoro-generate.py` enhanced with `--lang`, `--voice`, `--speed`, `--file` options.
- Japanese voice: `jf_nezumi` (speed 1.1). English voice: `af_heart` (speed 1.1).

**Verification:** Tested Japanese generation; produced 270k samples (64 KB). Works offline.

**Result:** Entire TTS stack is now 100% local, free, and consistent. No external dependencies.

**Commit:** `4f80a678` dev: Use Kokoro for all languages; remove Edge TTS dependency
