## Proactive Night Session (01:50 +07)
- Performed heartbeat scan during night hours (22:00–06:00 window).
- Found opportunity: Dashboard enhancement.
- Added system load (1/5/15 min) and memory usage stats to `dashboard.py`.
- Tested locally, committed, and pushed to GitHub.
- Logged in daily memory.
- No alerts needed (weather unavailable but not stormy; disk healthy; updates not critical; recent conversation <8h).

## Notes
- Continued building on the proactive creation principle from SOUL.md.
