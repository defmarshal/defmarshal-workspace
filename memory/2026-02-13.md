# 2026-02-13

## Proactive Night Session (01:50 +07)
- Performed heartbeat scan during night hours (22:00–06:00 window).
- Found opportunity: Dashboard enhancement.
- Added system load (1/5/15 min) and memory usage stats to `dashboard.py`.
- Tested locally, committed, and pushed to GitHub.
- Logged in daily memory.
- No alerts needed (weather unavailable but not stormy; disk healthy; updates not critical; recent conversation <8h).

## Second Proactive Build (02:20 +07)
- Created three utility scripts:
  - `show-holidays`: displays upcoming Indonesian holidays (next 60 days) from `indonesia-holidays-full-2026.md`.
  - `today-mem`: shows today's (by system date) or most recent daily memory file content.
  - `workspace-health`: one-line summary of disk usage, available package updates, and git status.
- Tested all scripts, made them executable.
- Committed and pushed to GitHub.
- Recorded in this memory.

## Third Proactive Build (05:36 +07)
- Built **Web Dashboard** (`web-dashboard.py` + wrapper `web-dashboard.sh`).
- Features: modern dark-themed single-page app with same data as CLI dashboard.
- Serves on http://localhost:8800, auto-refreshes every 60s.
- Fixed holiday parsing bug that prevented upcoming holidays from displaying.
- Tested server locally (curl /status returns JSON), committed and pushed.
- Added `WEB_DASHBOARD_README.md`.

## Notes
- Continued building on the proactive creation principle from SOUL.md.
- Fixed the holiday display issue in dashboard.py at the same time.
