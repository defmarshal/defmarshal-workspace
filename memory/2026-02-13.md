# 2026-02-13

## Morning Session
- User asked to read HEARTBEAT.md – performed checks: time (UTC+7), weather (Bangkok sunny 30°C), disk (64% used), updates available, next Indonesian holiday (Chinese New Year Feb 17, 4 days away).
- Suggested including cuti bersama in heartbeat check; noted upcoming cuti bersama: Feb 16 (Monday) – 3 days away.

## Agent System Exploration
- Discussed capabilities of persistent background agents via `sessions_spawn`.
- Spawned `hourly-banzai` agent: sends "BANZAI" to Telegram every hour, sleeps 3600s, loops indefinitely. Stop with "stop banzai". Label: hourly-banzai.
- Spawned `workspace-builder` agent: autonomous builder that scans workspace for build opportunities (uncommitted changes, TODOs, missing scripts), implements small improvements, commits/pushes, logs to `memory/workspace-builder.log`, respects quiet hours (23:00–08:00), repeats every 2h. Label: workspace-builder.
- `workspace-builder` first run: built `quick` unified command launcher supporting: dash, web, mem, search, health, holidays, git-status, help. Committed and pushed to master.

## OpenClaw Feature Overview
Discussed: cron, memory, heartbeats, weather, email (himalaya), GitHub, web search/fetch, browser automation, node control, TTS, multi-platform messaging, canvas/eval, gateway config/restart, healthcheck skill, ClawHub.

## Clawaifu-Selfie Setup & Scrapping

- Provided `FAL_KEY` (masked).
- Skill installed at `workspace/skills/clawaifu-selfie`.
- Config added to `openclaw.json` under `skills.entries.clawaifu-selfie` with env: `FAL_KEY`, `BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
- SOUL.md updated with selfie persona (Reze from Chainsaw Man – anime style, green eyes, black choker, subtle smile).
- Gateway restarted to load skill.
- First selfie test successful; second failed due to fal.ai balance exhausted.
- Explored free alternatives: Pollinations (blocked), Craiyon (blocked), Hugging Face (404/gated), Replicate ($5 top-up needed).
- Decision: Scrapped `clawaifu-selfie` integration due to no-cost constraints. Skill remains installed but not in use.
- Note: Selfie feature paused until budget allocated or local SD setup.

## Skill Install & Configuration
- **anime-lookup** installed via ClawHub at `workspace/skills/anime-lookup/`. Uses Jikan (MyAnimeList API), no auth required. Commands: `anime search`, `anime info <mal_id>`, `anime season`, `anime top`, `anime upcoming`.
- **edge-tts** installed via ClawHub at `workspace/skills/edge-tts/`. Microsoft Edge neural TTS, free, no API key. Supports voice/language/rate/pitch config. Default voice: `en-US-MichelleNeural`.
- **clawaifu-selfie**: manually installed at `workspace/skills/clawaifu-selfie/` (repo: swancho/clawaifu). Uses fal.ai Grok Imagine edit API. Required env: `FAL_KEY`, `BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Skill configured in `openclaw.json` under `skills.entries.clawaifu-selfie`. SOUL.md injected with selfie persona (Reze from Chainsaw Man: anime style, green eyes, black choker, subtle smile). Gateway restarted to load skill.

## Anime Companion Agent
Added capability to main agent: when asked about anime, it:
1. Uses `anime-lookup` to search and fetch details (mal_id, title, score, synopsis, episodes, studios, trailer)
2. Generates a TTS narration via `edge-tts` (default voice, normal rate) of the synopsis and key facts
3. Sends a character selfie via `clawaifu-selfie` with an appropriate prompt (mode: mirror for outfits, direct for locations)
4. Sends TTS audio file and image together in Telegram

Test trigger: "Tell me about <anime>" or "What's airing this season?"

## Selfie Testing
- First test: "Send me a selfie" → generated and sent successfully
- Second test: "What are you doing?" → failed: fal.ai balance exhausted (error: "User is locked. Reason: Exhausted balance.")
- fal.ai free tier: provides initial free credits; pay-per-use after credits run out. Need to top up at fal.ai/dashboard/billing for continued selfies.

## Workspace-Builder: Strategic Cron Agent
- Converted from persistent loop agent to cron-based scheduler (every 2 hours, Asia/Bangkok).
- Prompt upgraded: "Think deeply; identify a meaningful improvement with impact. Could be new utility, refactoring, docs, automation, or skill integration. Implement fully, test, commit with 'build:', push, log summary. Respect quiet hours (23:00-08:00)."
- Cron job created; next run in ~2h. Isolated agent per run for reliability.

## First Strategic Build: Anime Companion CLI
- Cron triggered workspace-builder at 11:04 UTC+7; run completed successfully (status OK, duration ~4.5 min).
- Build delivered: `anime-companion` script – unified CLI for anime exploration using Jikan API + optional TTS narration (edge-tts).
- Features: commands `search`, `info`, `top`, `season`, `upcoming`; `--tts` flag generates MP3 in `tts_output/`.
- Integrated into `quick` launcher (`quick anime ...`).
- Docs: `ANIME_COMPANION_README.md`.
- Updated `MEMORY.md` Tools & Skills section; added `.gitignore` for outputs and node_modules.
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub.
- Tested: `quick anime top 3`, `quick anime info 52991`, `quick anime info 52991 --tts`, etc. TTS works reliably.

Agent now sleeping until next scheduled run (every 2h).

## Quick Reference
- List agents: `sessions_list`
- Stop agent: kill session by key/label (main can manage subagents)
