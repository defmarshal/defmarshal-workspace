# 2026-02-18 — Dev-Agent Activity (late)

**Time:** 02:00–02:07 UTC  
**Agent:** dev-agent  
**Task:** Continuous improvements; fix torrent daemon architecture

---

## Torrent System Refactor

- Issue: `torrent-manager` unified daemon failed due to CLI incompatibility (`--agentId` unsupported)
- Action: Reverted to known‑good architecture
  - Removed broken `agents/torrent-manager/` directory
  - Restored `agents/torrent-bot/loop.sh` daemon keepalive script
  - Started `torrent-bot` daemon (PID 444878)
  - Updated `active-tasks.md` to `[daemon] torrent-bot (running)`
  - Confirmed `random-torrent-downloader` cron job remains active (auto‑fetch every 2 h)
- Commits:
  - `0acd436` remove obsolete torrent-bot daemon; agent on‑demand; random‑downloader cron remains
  - `351bad8` clean up obsolete torrent-manager directory after migration revert
  - `5fe07f4` mark torrent-bot daemon running; restored keepalive loop
- System health: disk 79%, gateway active, memory clean, validation passing

**Outcome:** Torrent system stable again; daemon keeps `torrent-bot` session alive for slash commands; cron handles periodic downloads.

# 2026-02-18 — Workspace Builder Activity

**Time:** 01:00–05:00 UTC (multiple phases)  
**Agent:** workspace-builder  
**Task:** Fix critical agent-manager bug; add memory observability; enforce active-tasks size policy

---

## Phase 1: Fix agent-manager Memory Reindex Logic (01:00 UTC)

### Problem
The agent-manager.sh had inverted memory-reindex-check logic: it triggered reindex on exit 0 (OK) and skipped on non-zero (needed). This mirrored a previously fixed meta-agent bug.

### Fix
Changed condition in `agents/agent-manager.sh` (lines 43-46) from:
```bash
if ./quick memory-reindex-check >/dev/null 2>&1; then
```
to:
```bash
if ! ./quick memory-reindex-check >/dev/null 2>&1; then
```
Added comment explaining exit codes (0=OK, 1=needed, 2=error).

### Verification
- Ran `./agents/agent-manager.sh --once`: no spurious reindex triggered (main store clean). Before fix, it would have attempted reindex every run.
- Logs confirmed correct behavior.

### Impact
- Stops unnecessary Voyage API calls (prevents 429 rate limits)
- Ensures reindex runs only when actually needed
- Aligns agent-manager with meta-agent pattern

### Commit
`34eed51` — "build: fix agent-manager memory reindex inverted logic; add memory-dirty command; update TOOLS.md with memory store details; validate system"

---

## Phase 2: Add Memory Observability (01:00 UTC)

Created `memory-dirty` quick command to show dirty status per memory store.

**Script** (`memory-dirty`):
```bash
openclaw memory status --json | python3 -c "import sys, json; data=json.load(sys.stdin); print('Memory Stores:'); [(print(f\"  {s.get('agentId','?')}: dirty={s.get('status',{}).get('dirty',False)} files={s.get('status',{}).get('files',0)} chunks={s.get('status',{}).get('chunks',0)}\") if isinstance(s, dict) else None) for s in (data if isinstance(data, list) else [data])]"
```

### Usage
```
$ quick memory-dirty
Memory Stores:
  main: dirty=False files=15 chunks=44
  torrent-bot: dirty=True files=0 chunks=0
  cron-supervisor: dirty=True files=0 chunks=0
```

Provides clear visibility into which stores need attention.

---

## Phase 3: Documentation Updates (01:00 UTC)

- **TOOLS.md**: Expanded Memory System section with:
  - Current Voyage AI rate limit status (3 RPM free tier)
  - Store details (main clean, torrent-bot & cron-supervisor dirty but benign)
  - Reindex policy (auto-disabled; manual only)
  - Observability commands: memory-status, memory-dirty, voyage-status
  - Instructions to re-enable (add payment, uncomment actions)
- **quick**: Added `memory-dirty` command to launcher and help text.

---

## Phase 4: Validation (01:00 UTC)

✅ agent-manager --once — correct behavior, no spurious reindex  
✅ memory-dirty — shows per-store dirty flags  
✅ quick health — system OK (disk 79%, gateway healthy)  
✅ memory-reindex-check — returns 0 for main store  
✅ No temp files leftover  
✅ All changes functional and committed

---

## Phase 5: Periodic Health Check (03:00 UTC)

Ran a second build to verify system stability after previous changes.

### Verification
- `quick health` — OK (disk 81%, gateway healthy, memory main clean)
- `quick memory-dirty` — shows unused agent stores dirty but benign
- TOOLS.md documentation clarified
- No critical issues

### Outcome
System operating optimally; no further action required at this time.

## Agent Manager Auto-Commit Bug Fix (05:18–05:20 UTC)

### Problem Discovered
The agent-manager's git dirty check used:
```bash
if ! git diff --quiet && ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
```
This only detects changes to **tracked** files. Untracked files (like `reports/2026-02-18-daily-digest.md`) were completely ignored, causing the auto-commit to skip even when the file count threshold was met.

### Root Cause
`git diff` operates on tracked files only. To include untracked files, you must use `git status --porcelain` or `git ls-files --others`.

### Fix Applied
Replaced the condition with a unified change counter:
```bash
changes=$(git status --porcelain | wc -l)
if [ "$changes" -gt 0 ]; then
  if [ "$changes" -lt 10 ]; then
    log "Git dirty ($changes files) but seems minor; attempting commit"
    git add -A
    git commit -m "build: auto-commit from agent-manager ($(date -u +%Y-%m-%d))" || true
    git push origin master || true
  else
    log "Git dirty with many changes ($changes files); skipping auto-commit"
  fi
fi
```

### Validation
- Manual run: `./agents/agent-manager.sh --once`
- Log output: "Git dirty (1 files) but seems minor; attempting commit"
- Auto-commit succeeded, pushing changes to origin/master
- Workspace clean after run

### Commit
`1f4ebf3` — "build: fix agent-manager git detection to include untracked files; validate system"

**Impact**: Daily digest reports and other new output files will now be auto-committed by agent-manager as intended, preventing accumulation of untracked artifacts.
