# 2026-02-18 — Dev-Agent Activity (late)

**Time:** 02:00–02:07 UTC  
**Agent:** dev-agent  
**Task:** Continuous improvements; fix torrent daemon architecture

---

## Torrent System Refactor

- Issue: `torrent-manager` unified daemon failed due to CLI incompatibility (`--agentId` unsupported)
- Action: Reverted to known‑good architecture
  - Removed broken `agents/torrent-manager/` directory
  - Restored `agents/torrent-bot/loop.sh` daemon keepalive script
  - Started `torrent-bot` daemon (PID 444878)
  - Updated `active-tasks.md` to `[daemon] torrent-bot (running)`
  - Confirmed `random-torrent-downloader` cron job remains active (auto‑fetch every 2 h)
- Commits:
  - `0acd436` remove obsolete torrent-bot daemon; agent on‑demand; random‑downloader cron remains
  - `351bad8` clean up obsolete torrent-manager directory after migration revert
  - `5fe07f4` mark torrent-bot daemon running; restored keepalive loop
- System health: disk 79%, gateway active, memory clean, validation passing

**Outcome:** Torrent system stable again; daemon keeps `torrent-bot` session alive for slash commands; cron handles periodic downloads.
