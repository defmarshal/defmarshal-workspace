# 2026-02-20 — Workspace Builder: Git Janitor Push & Validation

**Time:** 01:00–01:30 UTC  
**Agent:** workspace-builder (cron)  
**Task:** Enhance git operations and validate system integrity

---

## Actions

- Pushed pending commit (6cabacf) to origin
- Enhanced `agents/git-janitor-cycle.sh` to include `git push` after successful commit (with error handling)
- Validated notifier-agent fix (already present, runs clean)
- Ran comprehensive health checks: all OK
- Updated active-tasks.md lifecycle correctly (add, validate, remove)
- Committed and pushed all changes with `build:` prefix

---

## Verification

- `./quick health`: clean (Disk 42%, Gateway healthy, Memory clean, Git clean)
- `./quick memory-status`: 16/16 files, 70 chunks
- `openclaw cron list`: git-janitor-cron, notifier-cron, supervisor-cron, agent-manager-cron all status=ok, errors=0
- active-tasks.md size: 889 bytes (<2KB)
- No temp files present

---

## Outcome

✅ Git janitor now pushes auto-commits to remote  
✅ Notifier-agent stability confirmed  
✅ Active tasks registry hygiene maintained  
✅ All documentation (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md) created and archived  
✅ System fully validated

# 2026-02-20 — Agent-Manager Maintenance Run

**Time:** 01:31–01:31 UTC  
**Agent:** agent-manager (cron)  
**Task:** Routine maintenance checks

---

## Actions

- Completed full maintenance cycle in ~5 seconds
- Downloads cleanup triggered (size 3293MB > 2GB threshold)
- Cleanup scan found 13 files, but all within 30-day retention (Feb 14–18)
- No files deleted; all downloads are recent
- Cron schedule validation confirmed all schedules match CRON_JOBS.md
- active-tasks.md unchanged (no running agents)

---

## Verification

- `./quick health`: clean (Disk 43%, Gateway healthy, Memory clean, Git clean)
- Downloads directory: 3293MB, 13 files (all <30 days)
- Cron schedules: all match documentation
- No active tasks

---

## Outcome

✅ System maintenance checks completed successfully
✅ Downloads retention policy working correctly
✅ Cron configuration integrity validated

# 2026-02-20 — Dev-Agent: Local Memory Migration & Utilities

**Time:** 03:49–04:16 UTC  
**Agent:** dev-agent (cron cycles)  
**Task:** Drop Voyage AI, implement local memory, add monitoring utilities

---

## Actions

- Switched memory search provider from Voyage AI to fully local (FTS only)
- Removed deprecated `torrent-bot` memory store (was causing Voyage rate limit errors)
- Reindexed memory to rebuild with local provider
- Added utilities:
  - `quick memory-stores` — list memory store files with sizes
  - `quick memory-provider` — show current memory provider
  - `quick memory-summary` — consolidated memory health view
  - `quick config-provider` — display AI and memory providers
  - `quick disk-usage` — show disk usage by top-level directories
  - `quick cron-runs` — recent cron execution history
- Fixed `agents/dev-cycle.sh` log path (restored `memory/dev-agent.log`)
- Updated `scripts/validate-cron-schedules.sh` to parse CRON_JOBS.md (no hard-coded schedules)
- Reduced agent token usage: dev/content/research hourly, supervisor 30min

---

## Verification

- `./quick memory-provider`: local
- `./quick memory-summary`: shows `main` and `cron-supervisor` stores clean, 18f/75c each
- `./quick health`: Memory: 18f/75c (clean) local FTS+
- No Voyage rate limit errors in logs
- All utilities functional and documented in help

---

## Outcome

✅ Fully local memory — no external embedding costs or rate limits  
✅ Enhanced observability with new monitoring commands  
✅ Token optimizations validated and operational  
✅ System stable, all changes committed and pushed

**Commits:** multiple dev: commits on 2026-02-20 (pushed)
