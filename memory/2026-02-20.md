# 2026-02-20 — Dev-Agent: Local Memory Migration & Utilities

**Time:** 03:49–04:16 UTC  
**Agent:** dev-agent (cron cycles)  
**Task:** Drop Voyage AI, implement local memory, add monitoring utilities

---

## Actions

- Switched memory search provider from Voyage AI to fully local (FTS only)
- Removed deprecated `torrent-bot` memory store (was causing Voyage rate limit errors)
- Reindexed memory to rebuild with local provider
- Added utilities:
  - `quick memory-stores` — list memory store files with sizes
  - `quick memory-provider` — show current memory provider
  - `quick memory-summary` — consolidated memory health view
  - `quick config-provider` — display AI and memory providers
  - `quick disk-usage` — show disk usage by top-level directories
  - `quick cron-runs` — recent cron execution history
- Fixed `agents/dev-cycle.sh` log path (restored `memory/dev-agent.log`)
- Updated `scripts/validate-cron-schedules.sh` to parse CRON_JOBS.md (no hard-coded schedules)
- Reduced agent token usage: dev/content/research hourly, supervisor 30min

---

## Verification

- `./quick memory-provider`: local
- `./quick memory-summary`: shows `main` and `cron-supervisor` stores clean, 18f/75c each
- `./quick health`: Memory: 18f/75c (clean) local FTS+
- No Voyage rate limit errors in logs
- All utilities functional and documented in help

---

## Outcome

✅ Fully local memory — no external embedding costs or rate limits  
✅ Enhanced observability with new monitoring commands  
✅ Token optimizations validated and operational  
✅ System stable, all changes committed and pushed

**Commits:** multiple dev: commits on 2026-02-20 (pushed)

# 2026-02-20 — Rudra Executor Bug Fix & Diagnostic Utility

**Time:** 07:00–08:00 UTC  
**Agent:** dev-agent (manual cycles)  
**Task:** Fix Rudra executor crash and add quick test command

---

## Actions

- Identified root cause: `set -euo pipefail` with `((var++))` exits when var=0 (old value 0 treated as failure)
- Replaced arithmetic increments with safe forms: `total=$((total + 1))` and `fixed=$((fixed + 1))`
- Added `quick rudra-test` command to run Rudra on newest plan and report status with one click
- Verified fix via manual test runs: Rudra completes successfully, generates reports, pushes commits

---

## Verification

- Manual test: exit code 0, report generated, health check passed
- `quick rudra-test` runs and prints concise status
- Git commit pushed: `9d7d387 fix: Rudra executor - safe arithmetic increments to avoid 'set -e' exit on zero`
- Agni cron (06:00 UTC) produced plan but Rudra did not run (pre-fix); after fix, manual runs succeed
- Next scheduled Agni run (08:00 UTC) will use corrected Rudra

---

## Outcome

✅ Rudra executor now robust under `set -e`  
✅ Diagnostic tool `quick rudra-test` added for future testing  
✅ System stable; Agni→Rudra pipeline functional

**Commits:** 9d7d387 (pushed)

# 2026-02-20 — Research Hub Scaffolding & Vercel Integration

**Time:** afternoon UTC  
**Agent:** dev‑agent (manual cycles)  
**Task:** Create Next.js research portal and deployment automation

---

## Actions

- Scaffolded `apps/research-hub/` with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS
- Implemented prebuild script to copy `research/` markdown files into the app
- Created `setup-standalone-repo.sh` to migrate Research Hub to its own GitHub repo (manual due to allowlist restrictions)
- Added `quick vercel` command and `scripts/vercel-deploy.sh` for future deployment
- Updated TOOLS.md help and `quick` script

---

## Verification

- Next.js dev server runs locally (test build OK)
- Prebuild successfully copies research files
- Setup script documented; works when run manually by user
- `quick vercel` available and documented

---

## Outcome

✅ Research Hub web app structure ready for deployment  
✅ Automated prebuild keeps content in sync  
✅ Deployment path defined (user must run setup script or add `git`/`gh`/`vercel` to allowlist first)

**Commits:** research‑hub scaffolding and utilities (pushed)

# 2026-02-20 — Ongoing: Exec Allowlist Investigation

**Time:** afternoon UTC  
**Task:** Grant ability to run `git`, `gh`, `vercel` via exec

---

## Actions

- Researched OpenClaw security configuration: commands must be allowlisted in `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`
- Documentation confirms use of `host=gateway` with `security=allowlist`
- Identified required binary paths and pattern format (absolute path glob)
- Awaiting user to add entries and restart gateway

---

## Outcome

⏳ Pending manual edit to `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`  
⏳ After restart, `git`, `gh`, `vercel` will be runnable, enabling automated Research Hub deployment

**Commits:** none (config step pending)
