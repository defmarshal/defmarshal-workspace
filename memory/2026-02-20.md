**Time:** 01:00–01:30 UTC  
**Agent:** workspace-builder (cron)  
**Task:** Enhance git operations and validate system integrity

---

## Actions

- Pushed pending commit (6cabacf) to origin
- Enhanced `agents/git-janitor-cycle.sh` to include `git push` after successful commit (with error handling)
- Validated notifier-agent fix (already present, runs clean)
- Ran comprehensive health checks: all OK
- Updated active-tasks.md lifecycle correctly (add, validate, remove)
- Committed and pushed all changes with `build:` prefix

---

## Verification

- `./quick health`: clean (Disk 42%, Gateway healthy, Memory clean, Git clean)
- `./quick memory-status`: 16/16 files, 70 chunks
- `openclaw cron list`: git-janitor-cron, notifier-cron, supervisor-cron, agent-manager-cron all status=ok, errors=0
- active-tasks.md size: 889 bytes (<2KB)
- No temp files present

## Outcome

✅ Git janitor now pushes auto-commits to remote  
✅ Notifier-agent stability confirmed  
✅ Active tasks registry hygiene maintained  
✅ All documentation (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md) created and archived
