# 2026-02-16 Memory Log

## Key Events & Decisions

- **OpenClaw updated** from 2026.2.6-3 to 2026.2.15 (npm update)
- **Gateway config cleaned** — removed unused keys (delivery, wizard, meta, controlUi.port); restored known good baseline
- **Added utilities:**
  - `quick status` — one-line system summary, local, no approvals
  - `quick restart-gateway` — gateway recovery convenience
  - `quick torrent-status` — alias for downloads
  - `git-summary` — commit counts by prefix
- **Fixed bugs:**
  - `random-torrent-downloader.sh` now parses text output (not jq) and retries up to 3 attempts
  - `quick verify` cron count parsing robustified to handle non-JSON output
- **Infrastructure:**
  - Memory reindex age monitoring added to `workspace-health`
  - Active-tasks registry kept up to date
- **Social monitor agent** created (`social-monitor-agent.sh`) for hourly Twitter trending digest; ready for cron scheduling
- **Telegram slash commands** cleared by update — need manual re-registration via BotFather
- **Gateway** required multiple restarts due to token/port conflicts; now stable active
