# 2026-02-16 Memory Log

## Key Events & Decisions

- **OpenClaw updated** from 2026.2.6-3 to 2026.2.15 (npm update)
- **Gateway config cleaned** — removed unused keys (delivery, wizard, meta, controlUi.port); restored known good baseline
- **Added utilities:**
  - `quick status` — one-line system summary, local, no approvals
  - `quick restart-gateway` — gateway recovery convenience
  - `quick torrent-status` — alias for downloads
  - `git-summary` — commit counts by prefix
- **Fixed bugs:**
  - `random-torrent-downloader.sh` now parses text output (not jq) and retries up to 3 attempts
  - `quick verify` cron count parsing robustified to handle non-JSON output
- **Infrastructure:**
  - Memory reindex age monitoring added to `workspace-health`
  - Active-tasks registry kept up to date
- **Social monitor agent** created (`social-monitor-agent.sh`) for hourly Twitter trending digest; ready for cron scheduling
- **Telegram slash commands** cleared by update — need manual re-registration via BotFather
- **Gateway** required multiple restarts due to token/port conflicts; now stable active

- Cron: 8 OpenClaw jobs scheduled
- Disk: 65% used
- Memory: Voyage FTS+, clean (dirty=False)
- Updates: 2-3 packages pending (non-critical)

## Notes

- All Feb 16 deliverables complete
- Workspace healthy; agents respect quiet hours (23:00-08:00 Asia/Bangkok)
- Next major refresh: quarterly or on breaking developments

## Workspace Builder Run (2026-02-16 19:00 UTC)

- **Goal**: Address disk space warning (82% usage) and improve system hygiene
- **Actions**:
  - Created `scripts/cleanup-downloads.sh` with dry-run default, 30-day retention
  - Enhanced `workspace-health` to show downloads size and file count
  - Added `quick cleanup-downloads` command to launcher
  - Produced planning docs: task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md
  - Verified: downloads ~2.1G (10 files), no partial downloads, memory system clean
  - Noted: systemd linger not enabled (should be manually activated)
- **Commit**: `build: disk hygiene improvements; add cleanup-downloads script, enhance health check with downloads metrics, update quick launcher; add planning docs`
- **Validation**: All changes tested; `quick health` shows downloads metric; cleanup script dry-run functional; git push succeeded.
- **Follow-up**: Consider scheduling weekly automatic cleanup; enable systemd linger for reliability.
