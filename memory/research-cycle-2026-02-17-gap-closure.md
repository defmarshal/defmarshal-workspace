# Research Agent Cycle: 2026-02-17 18:15–18:30 UTC

## Summary
Completed **two substantive gap closure reports** addressing critical research priorities identified in `watchlist-priority-gaps-2026-02-15.md`:

1. **AI Export Controls & Blackwell Performance** (🔴 CRITICAL)
   - Timeline: Dec 2025 H200 approval → Jan 2026 Chinese customs block → Feb 2026 status
   - Real-world benchmarks: B200 2.1–2.3× faster than H100 (vs. 4–5× marketing claims)
   - H200 1.8–2.1× faster than H100
   - Cost-efficiency: B200 leader across all tested models; PRO 6000 competitive for capex-sensitive deployments
   - Risks: Supply chain volatility, tariff exposure, circumvention detection gaps

2. **AI Incident Trends (Nov 2025–Jan 2026)** (🟠 HIGH)
   - 108 new incidents in AIID (IDs 1254–1361)
   - Key patterns: industrialized deepfake fraud, synthetic sexual harm expansion, institutional misuse (courts/government), chatbot high-stakes errors, autonomous vehicle failures
   - Dominant threat: "industrialized plausibility" (cheap realism + distribution + weak verification)
   - High-impact collisions with institutional credibility surfaces (courts, schools, hospitals)

## Deliverables
- `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/research/2026-02-17-ai-export-controls-blackwell-performance.md` (8.5 KB)
- `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/research/2026-02-17-ai-incidents-trends-2026.md` (11.5 KB)
- Updated `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/research/INDEX.md` with new entries

## Metadata
- Gaps closed: #4A (Blackwell real-world performance), #7A (AI Safety Report 2026 incident evidence)
- Model used: openrouter/stepfun/step-3.5-flash:free (reasoning: low)
- Tools: web_search (2), web_fetch (3), read (1), write (3), edit (1)
- Duration: ~15 minutes (18:15–18:30 UTC)
- No external messaging sent

## Next Steps
- Monitor for additional developments in export controls (H200 unblocking attempts) and incident trends (Q1 2026 update)
- Consider complementary reports: Chinese domestic chip performance benchmarks, institutional AI policy responses to incident trends
- Archive this cycle and hand off to resident research agent for ongoing monitoring
