## Cron & Supervisor Activity

## System Status (01:xx UTC)

- Gateway: healthy
- Disk usage: 78% (stable)
- APT updates: none pending
- Git: clean after commits
- Memory: 29 fragments / 322 chunks indexed, reindex fresh (1d)
- Downloads: 31 files, 7.6GB total

## Active Agents

- meta-supervisor-daemon: running (PID 1121739)
- Various cron agents active

## Workspace Builder Run (01:02–01:?? UTC) — Completed ✅

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (every 2 hours)

**Plan:** Refresh planning docs, commit state, validate, close loop.

**Assessment:**
- Health: green (disk 78%, stable)
- active-tasks size: 615 bytes (<2KB)
- Downloads: 31 files, 7.6GB — no cleanup needed
- Memory: 29f/322c, reindex 1d fresh
- Git: cleaned after commits

**Key Actions:**
1. Created planning docs (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
2. Identified two pending tracked changes:
   - `memory/disk-history.json` — new metrics
   - `apps/dashboard/index.html` — header branding fix (ClawDash → MewDash for consistency with meta tags)
3. Committed changes (3 commits):
   - `build: update disk history metrics`
   - `build: fix dashboard branding consistency (ClawDash → MewDash in header)`
   - `build: workspace-builder planning docs and session registration`
4. Validated constraints (9/9 pass)
5. Updated active-tasks entry to validated with verification metrics
6. Pushed all commits to origin/master
7. Appended summary to daily log (this entry)

**Verification:**
- active-tasks.md: 615 bytes (<2KB) ✅
- MEMORY.md: 32 lines (≤35) ✅
- Health: green ✅
- Git: clean & pushed ✅
- Memory reindex: 1d fresh ✅
- No temp files ✅
- Shebang check: all scripts have #! ✅
- APT: none pending ✅
- Branch hygiene: no stale idea branches ✅
- Downloads: 31 files 7.6GB ✅
- Constraints: all 9/9 satisfied ✅

**Outcome:** Workspace validated and synchronized. All outputs versioned. Session properly closed. All systems green.

**Close the loop:** active-tasks.md updated with verification; daily log complete; constraints enforced.

## Notes

- All systems nominal.
- Continuing monitoring in next cycle.
