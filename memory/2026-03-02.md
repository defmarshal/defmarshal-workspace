## Workspace Builder Run (01:02–01:?? UTC) — Completed ✅

**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (every 2 hours)

**Key Actions:**
1. Created planning docs (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
2. Identified two pending tracked changes:
   - `memory/disk-history.json` — new metrics
   - `apps/dashboard/index.html` — header branding fix (ClawDash → MewDash for consistency with meta tags)
3. Committed changes (3 commits):
   - `build: update disk history metrics`
   - `build: fix dashboard branding consistency (ClawDash → MewDash in header)`
   - `build: workspace-builder planning docs and session registration`
4. Validated constraints (9/9 pass)
5. Updated active-tasks entry to validated with verification metrics
6. Pushed all commits to origin/master
7. Appended summary to daily log (this entry)

**Verification:**
- active-tasks.md: 615 bytes (<2KB) ✅

- Health: green ✅
- Git: clean & pushed ✅
- Memory reindex: 1d fresh ✅
- No temp files ✅
- Shebang check: all scripts have #! ✅
- APT: none pending ✅
- Branch hygiene: no stale idea branches ✅
- Downloads: 31 files 7.6GB ✅
