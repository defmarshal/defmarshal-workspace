## Workspace Builder Run (15:24 UTC)

**Context:** Regular 2-hourly maintenance cycle. System health excellent; focus on finalizing pending changes and hygiene enforcement.

**Analysis findings:**
- Health: OK (Disk 67%, Gateway healthy, Memory clean, Git clean after push)
- active-tasks.md: 1846 bytes (<2KB); MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- No pending APT updates (previously 17 were noted, now applied)
- Idea pipeline: idle; last successful execution created `idea/create-quick-command-to-find` (validated 14:12) but branch remained as stale; cleaned up
- No other stale branches
- No untracked files

**Actions performed:**
1. Pushed pending commit `05ca2652` (daily digest update)
2. Verified APT updates status: all up to date
3. Deleted stale idea branch `idea/create-quick-command-to-find`
4. Pruned `active-tasks.md` by removing oldest completed entry (2026-02-24 09:13) to maintain ≤2KB constraint
5. Committed planning updates and cleanup: `3961f037`
6. Added validation entry for this session to `active-tasks.md` and committed: `1c4e966d`
7. Pushed both commits to origin

**Commits:**
- `3961f037` build: workspace hygiene - prune active-tasks, delete stale idea branch, update planning
- `1c4e966d` build: mark workspace-builder session validated (2026-02-24 15:24 UTC)

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: OK (Disk 67%, Gateway healthy, Memory clean, Git clean)
- active-tasks.md: 1846 bytes (<2KB); MEMORY.md: 30 lines
- No temp files, no stale branches
- Git clean, up to date with origin

**Outcome:** Workspace hygiene fully maintained. All pending changes finalized, documented, and pushed. System ready for next cycles.
