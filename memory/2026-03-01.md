   - session log (memory/2026-03-01-0926.md)
   - updated daily digest (content/2026-03-01-daily-digest-updated.md)
2. Committed continuously-modified state files (disk-history.json, heartbeat-state.json)
3. Updated active-tasks.md verification to reflect actual final metrics
4. Pushed all commits to origin/master
