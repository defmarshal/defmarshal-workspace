## 2026-02-17 — Session Highlights

**System Enhancements:**
- Added quick utilities: `checkpoints`, `phase`, `session-locks`, `today`, `meta-commit`, `cleanup-untracked`, `git-last`
- Disabled supervisor auto-reindex due to Voyage AI rate limits; manual `./quick memory-reindex` recommended
- Fixed supervisor cron health check jq query (use .state.lastStatus)
- Meta-agent permission fix (chmod +x) pending approval

**Agent Activity:**
- Content-agent: Produced multiple status updates; archive grew to 54 files
- Research-agent: Brief series covering anime AI adoption, AI governance, power constraints, model trends, production pipeline
- Dev-agent: Continuous improvements; kept active-tasks pruned to 2KB
- Supervisor: Monitored health; occasional alerts about memory reindex

**Notes:**
- Voyage AI memory reindex rate-limited on free tier (3 RPM). Consider adding payment method or scheduling off-hours reindex
- Meta-agent planning files (findings.md, progress.md, task_plan.md) appear untracked; `quick meta-commit` available
- System overall healthy; all agents cycling normally
