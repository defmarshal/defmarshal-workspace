## Workspace Builder Run (2026-02-17 03:00 UTC)

### Goals
- Address critical issues: gateway health (already ok), MEMORY.md oversize
- Improve system hygiene: clean pycache, archive builder artifacts
- Documentation: systemd linger recommendation

### Actions Completed
✅ **Memory Reorganization**
- Trimmed MEMORY.md to index format (1348 bytes, <6KB injection limit)
- Created MEMORY_HISTORY.md preserving full narrative (13766 bytes)
- Index points to history + other thematic files (projects.md, lessons.md)

✅ **Hygiene**
- Removed all __pycache__ directories (6 locations)
- Verified clean workspace: no large temp files

✅ **Artifact Management**
- Created `builds/` directory
- Archived current builder planning files to `builds/build-2026-02-17-0304/`
- Committed archive to GitHub

✅ **Documentation**
- Added systemd linger recommendation to MEMORY.md
- Updated active-tasks.md with builder validation notes

✅ **Validation**
- quick health: all systems healthy
- Memory search functional (tested)
- Git status clean after commits

## Workspace Builder Run (2026-02-17 07:00 UTC)

### Goals
- Ensure workspace health and address minor issues
- Clean up orphaned memory database, verify cron jobs
- Update documentation, archive planning artifacts

### Actions Completed
✅ **Memory Hygiene**
- Backed up orphaned torrent-bot memory database (unused, dirty flag)
- Main memory remains healthy (8/8 files, 34 chunks, clean)

✅ **Cron Maintenance**
- Removed duplicate cleanup-agent-artifacts cron (old daily at 02:00)
- Documented three new agent cron jobs in CRON_JOBS.md: agent-manager-cron (every 30min), agni-cron (every 2h), vishwakarma-cron (every 4h)

✅ **Hygiene**
- Fixed missing exec bit on `games/anime-studio-tycoon/build.sh`
- Verified no CRLF, large files, pycache; all clean

✅ **Documentation & Archival**
- Updated CRON_JOBS.md with new jobs
- Archived planning files to `builds/build-2026-02-17-0708/`
- Pruned active-tasks.md to stay under 2KB (removed superseded entries, shortened notes)

✅ **Validation**
- quick health: all systems OK
- Memory search functional
- Git clean after commits

### Commit History
1. `6774b55` - build: fix hygiene (build.sh exec), remove duplicate cleanup-agent-artifacts cron, document new agent cron jobs (agent-manager, agni, vishwakarma), archive planning artifacts, update active-tasks validation
2. `019145f` - build: prune active-tasks.md (remove superseded entries, shorten notes) to stay under 2KB

### Current State
- Disk: 78% used (healthy)
- Updates: 25 pending
- Memory: main clean; torrent-bot DB backed up (inactive scope)
- Gateway: healthy
- Downloads: 10 files, 2.1G
- Cron jobs: 18 enabled OpenClaw cron (plus system watchdog)
- active-tasks.md: 1708 bytes (within limit)

### Notes
- Duplicate cleanup-agent-artifacts cron removed; only weekly (Sun 09:30) remains.
- New agent schedulers (agent-manager, agni, vishwakarma) now fully documented.
- Build artifacts archived; workspace root clean.

### Agent Manager Cron Stuck (07:35 UTC)

- **Issue**: `agent-manager-cron` (524a0d6f) showed `runningAtMs` stuck but no active session or lock file.
- **Impact**: Could block subsequent 30-minute runs until manual reset.
- **Fix**: Updated cron job state via `openclaw cron update` to clear `runningAtMs` (set to 0).
- **Verification**: Cron list now shows `runningAtMs: 0`; next run at 08:03 Bangkok (07:33 UTC schedule).
- **Note**: Manual run of `agent-manager.sh` completed successfully, triggering memory reindex and downloads cleanup.
