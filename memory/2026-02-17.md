## 2026-02-17 — Session Highlights

**System Enhancements:**
- Added quick utilities: `checkpoints`, `phase`, `session-locks`, `today`, `meta-commit`, `cleanup-untracked`, `git-last`
- Disabled supervisor auto-reindex due to Voyage AI rate limits; manual `./quick memory-reindex` recommended
- Fixed supervisor cron health check jq query (use .state.lastStatus)
- Meta-agent permission fix (chmod +x) pending approval

**Agent Activity:**
- Content-agent: Produced multiple status updates; archive grew to 54 files
- Research-agent: Brief series covering anime AI adoption, AI governance, power constraints, model trends, production pipeline
- Dev-agent: Continuous improvements; kept active-tasks pruned to 2KB
- Supervisor: Monitored health; occasional alerts about memory reindex
- Meta-agent: Repeated memory reindex attempts failed due to Voyage AI rate limiting (3 RPM free tier). Retry logic active but hitting hard limits. Consider adding payment method or throttling further.

**Notes:**
- Voyage AI memory reindex rate-limited on free tier (3 RPM). Consider adding payment method or scheduling off-hours reindex with larger delays
- Meta-agent planning files (findings.md, progress.md, task_plan.md) appear untracked; `quick meta-commit` available
- System overall healthy; all agents cycling normally

## Meta‑Agent Memory Reindex Failures (Throughout 2026‑02‑17)

**Issue**: Memory reindex triggered by meta‑agent cron repeatedly fails with Voyage AI 429 rate‑limit errors.  
**Pattern**: Meta‑agent runs at various times (10:12, 11:07, 11:15, 12:14, 13:07, 16:14, 17:08, 21:18 UTC). Each attempt:  
1. Detects memory needs reindex  
2. Triggers reindex  
3. Hits rate limit after ~12‑13 embedding calls  
4. Fails with: *"You have not yet added your payment method in the billing page and will have reduced rate limits of 3 RPM and 10K TPM."*

**Impact**: Memory index not refreshed; search may become stale over time. Rate‑lock already implemented (skip 1h after 429), but free tier is too restrictive for full reindex.

**Options**:  
- Add payment method to Voyage AI account (recommended)  
- Increase backoff and batch size to stay under 3 RPM (may take ~20min+ for full reindex)  
- Switch to alternative embedding provider  
- Disable auto‑reindex and run manually only when needed

**Current status**: Meta‑agent continues to attempt; all tasks marked "one‑shot completed" even on failure (expected behavior).

## Workspace Builder Run (2026-02-17 19:00 UTC)

**Goal**: Documentation updates (msearch case-insensitivity), add research-cycle log, prune active‑tasks.
**Verification**: `./quick health` OK; `./msearch` and `./quick search` functional; git push succeeded (commits 04e4e12, c85dec1); system clean.
**Outcome**: Completed and validated.
