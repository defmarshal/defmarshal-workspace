## Workspace Builder Run (2026-02-17 03:00 UTC)

### Goals
- Address critical issues: gateway health (already ok), MEMORY.md oversize
- Improve system hygiene: clean pycache, archive builder artifacts
- Documentation: systemd linger recommendation

### Actions Completed
✅ **Memory Reorganization**
- Trimmed MEMORY.md to index format (1348 bytes, <6KB injection limit)
- Created MEMORY_HISTORY.md preserving full narrative (13766 bytes)
- Index points to history + other thematic files (projects.md, lessons.md)

✅ **Hygiene**
- Removed all __pycache__ directories (6 locations)
- Verified clean workspace: no large temp files

✅ **Artifact Management**
- Created `builds/` directory
- Archived current builder planning files to `builds/build-2026-02-17-0304/`
- Committed archive to GitHub

✅ **Documentation**
- Added systemd linger recommendation to MEMORY.md
- Updated active-tasks.md with builder validation notes

✅ **Validation**
- quick health: all systems healthy
- Memory search functional (tested)
- Git status clean after commits
