   - Services restarted (cron, cups-browsed, fwupd, packagekit, pm2-ubuntu)
2. Added untracked research file to git and committed:
   - `build: add pending research output (anime industry trends 2026)`
3. Deleted stale idea branch `idea/add-progress-bar-to-the`
4. Verified Research Hub index status (no update needed)
5. Comprehensive health check: all constraints satisfied
6. Updated `active-tasks.md` with this session's validation entry:

## Meta-Agent Run (02:09 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `meta-agent-cron` (scheduled hourly)

**System snapshot:**
- Disk: 69% (healthy)
- APT updates: 0 pending
- Content produced today: 5 files
- Research produced today: 1 file
- Memory: Voyage AI rate-limited, learning disabled
- Active agents: within caps

**Analysis:**

**Trigger:** Manual execution (cron scheduled run based on policy)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 69% (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Memory: clean, local FTS+, reindexed 1.2d ago

   - Upgraded: python3-software-properties, software-properties-common, software-properties-gtk
   - Services restarted: cron, cups-browsed, fwupd, packagekit
2. Deleted stale branches:
   - `git branch -D idea/add-dark-mode-toggle-to`
   - `git branch -D idea/create-quick-command-to-find`
3. Pruned active-tasks.md:
   - Removed oldest validated entry (`workspace-builder-20260224-2300`)
   - Trimmed verification texts for brevity
   - Final size: 1757 bytes (under 2KB)
4. Created planning documentation per workflow:

6. Committed all changes:
   - `build: apply security updates, cleanup stale branches, enforce active-tasks constraint, update planning docs`
7. Pushed to origin

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: Disk 69%, Updates none, Git clean, Memory clean, Gateway healthy, Downloads 17/5.7G
- active-tasks.md: 1757 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines
