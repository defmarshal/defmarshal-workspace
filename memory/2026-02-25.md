**Trigger:** Cron job `workspace-builder-cron` (scheduled every 2 hours)

**System snapshot before:**
- Disk: 69% (healthy)

- Pending APT updates: 4 (curl security, libcurl, nodejs)
- Downloads: 17 files, 5.7GB
- active-tasks.md: ~2KB
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines

**Analysis:**
- Research agent produced `2026-02-25-anime-industry-trends-2026.md` but it was untracked
- Stale idea branch `idea/add-progress-bar-to-the` needed cleanup
- Security updates pending; should be applied promptly
- System otherwise healthy; no disk pressure

**Actions performed:**
1. Applied APT updates (4 packages) via `quick updates-apply --execute`
   - curl, libcurl4t64, libcurl3t64-gnutls, nodejs upgraded
   - Services restarted (cron, cups-browsed, fwupd, packagekit, pm2-ubuntu)
2. Added untracked research file to git and committed:
   - `build: add pending research output (anime industry trends 2026)`
3. Deleted stale idea branch `idea/add-progress-bar-to-the`
4. Verified Research Hub index status (no update needed)
5. Comprehensive health check: all constraints satisfied
6. Updated `active-tasks.md` with this session's validation entry:
   - Session key: `workspace-builder-20260225-0110`
   - Pruned oldest completed entry to maintain <2KB
   - Committed: `build: mark workspace-builder session validated (2026-02-25 01:10 UTC)`
7. Pushed both commits to origin
8. Created planning documentation per planning-with-files workflow:
   - `task_plan.md` (strategic plan)
   - `findings.md` (analysis)
   - `progress.md` (execution tracking)
   - Committed: `build: update planning docs with execution results and progress log`
9. Final validation: git clean, health green, constraints met

**Commits:**
- f6dd9e46 build: add pending research output (anime industry trends 2026)
- 5198eabe build: mark workspace-builder session validated (2026-02-25 01:10 UTC)
- 42d1e9b1 build: update planning docs with execution results and progress log

**Validation:**
- `./quick health`: Disk 69%, Updates none, Git clean, Memory clean, Gateway healthy, Downloads 17 files 5.7G
- active-tasks.md: 1939 bytes (<2KB)
- MEMORY.md: 30 lines

## Meta-Agent Run (02:09 UTC)

**Trigger:** Cron job `meta-agent-cron` (scheduled hourly)

**System snapshot:**
- Disk: 69% (healthy)
- APT updates: 0 pending
- Content produced today: 5 files
- Research produced today: 1 file
- Memory: Voyage AI rate-limited, learning disabled
- Active agents: within caps

**Analysis:**
- Both content and research agents have produced output today, so no spawn needed
- Disk usage below cleanup threshold (80%)
- No skill usage spikes detected in past 24h (web_search/gmail/weather counts low)
- All permanent agents (archive-agent, git-janitor, notifier, archiver-manager) already registered
