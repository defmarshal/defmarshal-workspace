- Stale idea branch `idea/add-progress-bar-to-the` needed cleanup
- Security updates pending; should be applied promptly

   - curl, libcurl4t64, libcurl3t64-gnutls, nodejs upgraded
   - Services restarted (cron, cups-browsed, fwupd, packagekit, pm2-ubuntu)
2. Added untracked research file to git and committed:
   - `build: add pending research output (anime industry trends 2026)`
3. Deleted stale idea branch `idea/add-progress-bar-to-the`
4. Verified Research Hub index status (no update needed)
5. Comprehensive health check: all constraints satisfied
6. Updated `active-tasks.md` with this session's validation entry:
   - Session key: `workspace-builder-20260225-0110`
   - Pruned oldest completed entry to maintain <2KB
   - Committed: `build: mark workspace-builder session validated (2026-02-25 01:10 UTC)`
7. Pushed both commits to origin
8. Created planning documentation per planning-with-files workflow:
   - `task_plan.md` (strategic plan)
   - `findings.md` (analysis)
   - `progress.md` (execution tracking)
   - Committed: `build: update planning docs with execution results and progress log`
9. Final validation: git clean, health green, constraints met

**Commits:**
- f6dd9e46 build: add pending research output (anime industry trends 2026)
- 5198eabe build: mark workspace-builder session validated (2026-02-25 01:10 UTC)
- 42d1e9b1 build: update planning docs with execution results and progress log
