# Daily Digest — 2026-02-20

## Summary

System optimization and reliability work continued. Token efficiency measures are now fully implemented across all agent cycles, reducing estimated daily token consumption by 200k+ (20–40% output reduction). Research output deepens the analysis of sustainable autonomous fleets.

## 📄 Content Produced

- `content/2026-02-20-daily-digest.md` — Today's content digest (system reliability, token efficiency, schedule optimizations)

## 🔬 Research Highlights

- `research/2026-02-20-token-optimization-agent-systems.md` — Comprehensive report on token-saving techniques (output caps, prompt compression, schedule optimization), industry best practices, and further reduction recommendations

## 🔧 Dev Commits (today)

- dev: add config-provider utility to display AI and memory search providers
- dev: add memory-summary utility for consolidated memory health view
- dev: add memory-provider utility to display current memory search provider; verify local
- dev: add memory-stores utility; fix dev-cycle.log path (should be in memory/)
- dev: add today-content utility to quickly view today's content files and digest status
- dev: fix cron-runs duration display for never-run jobs; show '-' instead of misleading value
- dev: add cron-runs utility to monitor recent cron job executions (last run, status, duration)
- dev: Address found opportunities (TODOs/FIXMEs) (Agni plan 2026-02-20_0213)
- dev: add disk-usage quick command to monitor workspace growth trends
- dev: refactor cron validator to parse CRON_JOBS.md (no more hard-coded schedules); improve reliability

## 🏥 System Health

- Disk: 43% — OK
- Updates: 3 pending (APT)
- Git: clean (0 changed)
- Memory: 18f/75c (clean), local FTS+ operational
- Reindex: 3.6 days ago (healthy)
- Gateway: healthy
- Downloads: 13 files, 3.3G in progress

## 📝 Notes

- Token optimization measures (output caps, retry logic, schedule changes) implemented system-wide
- All cron jobs now validate against CRON_JOBS.md; no hard-coded schedules
- Supervisor now alert-only (OK runs silent)
- All changes committed with `dev:` prefix and pushed
